anything remote and you are applying against thousands of others to compete in obtaining a great job opportunity while getting filtered out by ai. i get they want you to be in tech for years before getting into a cybersecurity role to understand core concepts and have experience. however i m seeing entry level jobs with      years required which to me is insane. at that point that s definitely a senior role and should not be listed as entry level. another thing job opportunities mess up in is specifying onsite or remote based work. i can t tell you how many jobs out there say remote but upon further reading of the job description or filling out an application there then reads must be onsite . if it s a remote job then make it remote don t lie to others unless the company offers both. i m only a year in it doing help desk but i m seeing grc specialist network engineers etc being laid off and struggling to find a job. companies really need to hire more people who will put the time in and strengthen an organization. yet companies are cheap and not hiring more people or a manager wants someone who has years of experience but not enough to make the hiring managers themselves look bad. i have a lot of law enforcement some doctors and others in my family and i m really stating to regret picking the it route. not because it s boring since i find technology to be fascinating but due to the fact that if this is the job market for the coming years i d hate to have to work    years just to finally get a better job in a specialization. if you read this entire post then thank you for taking time to do so and anyone is welcomed to share their input.', 'masters in cybersecurity hello all. thanks in advance for reading this post. i have a job that is going to pay for master s program and i figured why not if it s free. i know there is a lot of negativity around master s programs but i assume a big con with that mindset is the      k of debt to get it which isn t a factor here. i m looking for guidance on if i should do an mba with cybersecurity focus or master s of compsci with cybersecurity focus. so managerial vs technical. i do eventually want to manage but i want to improve my technical prowess as much as i can before going into management. i ve had managers that were great hard workers but they weren t technical.... and i didn t really enjoy working for them as much as i do my managers that had a decently strong technical side to them. i figured i could always get a cissp or equivalent later on if i go for technical master s. here s quick story of my short it career below: acquired business information systems bachelors degree and immediately landed helpdesk job.   year at helpdesk led team in tickets closed calls answered time per call etc and promoted to desktop    months at desktop led team of   in tickets closed there as well. company suffered breach and all of the sudden a cybersecurity department popped up out of no where with   analyst positions i got one of them. so basically glorified desktop support with cybersecurity analyst title. imposter syndrome ensued extremely hard for a while.   years as cybersecurity analyst at this company managing all phishing campaigns and anything else that comes along with that handling all umbrella tickets crowdstrike edr and incident response etc. learned a whole lot of osint tools. basically identifying if a threat was real and letting the sys admins know then they would handle it. really lost passion became depressed being     remote and being around people. realized fully remote wasn t for me and i needed a hybrid position for mental health. applied for a cybersecurity administrator job at small company that s hybrid and got it. i have been at new job for   months and they will pay for   k   k master s. so here we are. i m not the most technical person on the block. my success comes from soft skills decent at interviews and strong work ethic. i obviously lack experience as only have about   years total in it. i would rate my technical skills as maybe a   or   out of   .... i want to increase my technical prowess but am nervous if i get into the compsci master s i won t be able to do it or it will take a ton of time since i m not as technical as engineering compsci bachelor degree holders. i asked the recruiters how intense the compsci program was an didn t really get an answer they just said    hours per week per class but mba said same thing... the schools i m applying for are in the   k   k range so these aren t super high level prestigious schools. take that for what it s worth. i really appreciate anyone that actually read this wall of text.... i would really appreciate any insight opinion especially master degree holders similar to the ones i m chasing. it would just suck to get into the compsci master s program and feel overwhelmed with how intensely technical it may be and not be able to do it it really at the end of the day is confidence issues because i ve been around some technical people that really impressed me and i know i m not on their level.... if i don t pass i don t get the free money from work btw lol. thanks again : cheers', 'entry level professionals: do you feel that you are developing in your role i have a bachelor s in cybersecurity and just over two years of experience in the industry across two separate roles. i m creating this thread because i feel i have learned almost nothing of use in either of these roles and have not developed any real technical skills either. i am wondering if anyone else feels the same way. i d say    of my time at work is making spreadsheets or some other form of busywork. i ve learned some python in my spare time to automate what i can but i ve never really felt challenged in any project. i left my last role after my boss told me that he did not have anything more interesting for me to do only to end up doing more or less the same thing at my current job where i ve been for just over a year. i am trying to continue my professional development through online courses in what little free time i have but my ultimate question is: is it supposed to be this way i know that entry level positions are often stuck with the menial work that senior engineers don t want to do but is it normal to barely learn anything at all the job market is tough right now and i don t want to be stuck in an entry level position forever. anyone who can share their experience in this level of the industry will be greatly appreciated.']",outlier/misc

requires installing an agent on every endpoint and server funneling practically all event logs from these systems. this setup allows visibility into every background process and job event log based on the gpo that filters the categories of event logs for siem ingestion. this comprehensive log access has extended the use of our siem beyond security serving as a tool for daily troubleshooting and

expertise product im building cyber security expertise consulting into a product. this would be for companies that are either   at the beginning of their security journey but lack time resources and expertise to get started or   know that current best practices and compliance is not enough to protect their business and want better practical advice the whole idea is based off url and i know that depending on who you are that term may be unfamiliar. i believe that the defense should be tailored to the unique context of the business what real threats and attacks are actually happening out there and are the most likely realistic. i believe this approach is more effective than traditional risk assessments that consulting firms do vciso services etc. you can think of it as organizational threat modeling this is selling expertise not implementation and i know that may not be what folks are looking for so curious about feedback. the core offering would be a saas platform that you log into and answer a series of questions about your business. you receive:   a list of the most likely ways a cyber attack could manifest at your organization so you can follow a story instead of a dry list of recommended technical controls.   each attack scenario can be broken down into your biggest risks matching of defenses control options and detailed vendo subreddit mapping  clear business roi metrics for each risk and control the whole point of this platform is to give folks access to cyber expertise and give them the ability to make decisions on their own with this information. for example my hot take here is that after matching your unique risk profile to the most likely threats out there you may be better off spending your time and money on  fa or an extra control on your accounts payable system to prevent fraud that focus on the choke points of attacks than more generic advice like: vulnerability management or patch everything or security awareness training. if we look at the data a large majority of attacks are opportunistic and shared among the same victims and the same thing keeps happening over and over again. current best practices are not enough and not one size fits all.

cybersecurity to help them grow their revenue. my official title in my last two roles has been head of growth which is just a nice way of saying i do whatever is necessary to help a startup grow. i don t normally start posts about myself but i wanted to share just a little bit for credibility here because i m very very good at something that i think will help a lot of you   i m s tier at getting executives to invest money into valuable initiatives. i think this is something that most humans responsible for the security of their organization really struggle with. often cybersecurity compliance is seen as an afterthought. do we really need to do this is there actually a value to this penetration test what s the easiest way for us to get this done cybersecurity departments at startups large organizations are notoriously one of the most under resourced teams. ciso s begging for headcount cfo s trying to squeeze efficiency by citing miserable industry benchmarks. to make matters worse cybersecurity can seem to be an infinite money pit where even if you do throw millions of dollars at the problem of trying to become secure there is still a chance that you will get compromised. if you re responsible for the data security of your organization this post is to help you get the resources you need to be successful. the most important rule of winning internal resources for cybersecurity is this: there are only three reasons startups invest in cybersecurity they ve been compromised before it s blocking a deal or they are required to by law. recovering from a data breach: they ve been compromised before. i like to start with the they ve been compromised before because this is the source of the business need for investing into cybersecurity. even legal regulations are simply based on the key concept that companies are getting hacked . there s a rule called murphy s law that states anything that can go wrong will go wrong. if you work in cybersecurity this is probably one of the most important principles for you to understand. it pays for your salary it s what will get you promoted this is the driving force behind the business need of cybersecurity. imagine for a moment if   people go to a work event and get really drunk. there s a non zero chance that one of them does something stupid and needs to get fired. but also there s a really strong chance probably       that nothing bad is going to happen. this is fine. now imagine that there s    people who go to a work event and get really drunk. much bigger chance something bad happens. now imagine    . now imagine      . now imagine       . the more surface area you have what used to be a small team grabbing drinks turns into something bad will absolutely happen. cybersecurity is like this. when you are small your surface area is much smaller. sure you re still a target but you re flying under the radar there s a much smaller chance you are going to be compromised. but as you scale you introduce more humans your product surface area increases you launch multiple products you have old legacy code nobody actually understands anymore you enter more geographies. you also launch or product hunt hackernews you get pr on forbes. you raise more money you make more money you hold more sensitive data. your likelihood of having a data leak or becoming compromised scales exponentially as the organization grows your value as a target grows right alongside your attack surface area. and eventually anything bad that can happen does happen. this is why large organizations are basically forced to invest in cybersecurity. at a certain scale and surface area it s basically a guarantee to become compromised. you are almost promised to become compromised if you do not invest in a certain level of security. some organizations absolutely begin to implement strong controls long before this happens but also many don t. i m just going to be really transparent trying to convince a ceo or a chief product officer to invest in cybersecurity before they ve been hacked and personally feel the pain is going to be really really hard. you can try to show them personal stories of similar companies industry stats bring in consultants to give an outside view   but it s going to be hard. the secret cheat code help them see security as a way to increase revenue not simply prevent threats. security gaps costing millions: it s blocking a deal. because large startups are basically forced under a near inevitability of being compromised to start investing in cybersecurity they will begin to require that anyone who provides services or integrations to them are also secure. this is your secret weapon if you are in an early stage company who has not yet experienced the pain of a security breach. a strong security posture doesn t just help you prevent your organization from being compromised it can be a critical tool and a strong value prop to your marketing sales team. the dirty secret of a soc   report is that it s for your marketers and sales reps not necessarily your security team. your security team knows whether or not you are secure. the soc   report is so other people know you are secure. when your organization is selling into a company that cares about security actually becoming secure can help you unlock a lot more business. maybe it s only   of your business. but maybe    or more of your business has the potential of coming from enterprise organizations. a strong security posture helps you not only unblock these deals but to maximize your revenue. even   on a business that s doing    m a year is a  m a year unlock. if half the business is enterprise then that s   m a year that s being assisted and empowered through your security efforts. a strong security posture is not only going to be a binary requirement for closing these deals it s going to help you get through the process faster it s going to help you increase the speed of your buying cycles. you know what sales reps ceo s and cfo s all hate having a           deal held up for     weeks because the ciso is unhappy with one of your security controls. here s a few tricks to talk about the value of your security as it relates to revenue:  . go into hubspot or salesforce pull the account information and show the historic information of how many deals have been assisted by your security posture.  . estimate the market size that can be unblocked by obtaining a strong security posture. show confidence intervals if we close   deals worth         each that s    k. if we close    deals worth           each that s   m. in each case our security expense is x of this potential revenue.  . pull in quotes feedback from the sales reps. how are they being impacted by ciso s and it managers asking about security how often does this come up how long do deals get stuck in security review if your business is selling into organizations that care about security you should be able to turn your security posture not just into an operating cost that we want to keep as small as possible but a value prop that people will want to invest into because it will help drive more revenue and speed up sales cycles. avoiding fines: it s required by law. the final reason that people invest into cybersecurity is that it s being required by law. if this is you i want to give a sincere plea to please take this seriously. i get how hard it is to create a startup to simply build something that somebody wants to get to ramen profitability. needing to comply with regulations like hipaa or gdpr can seem like a colossal waste of time that s just getting in your way of driving revenue. if you re being required by law to implement cybersecurity you need to realize that this is only happening because you are handling some of the most sensitive data on the planet that governments have felt the need to regulate. so take a deep breath and meditate for a moment on what it really means to protect your users privacy. that you are being entrusted with something sacred your users trust. don t take this simply as a box that needs to be checked and a list of bare minimum requirements we need to dance through but a warning sign. you are holding sensitive data. people are very likely going to try and get this data from you. you need to protect it. and there will be consequences if you do not protect. hipaa violations have a four tiered system for fines penalties: tier  : lack of knowledge: the lowest tier with a minimum penalty of     and a maximum penalty of       . tier  : reasonable cause and not willful neglect: a minimum penalty of       and a maximum penalty of       . tier  : willful neglect corrected within    days: a minimum penalty of        and a maximum penalty of       . tier  : willful neglect not timely corrected: a minimum penalty of        and a maximum penalty of          . on top of all of the consequences of simply having a data breach or becoming compromised depending on the regulation type there are additional imposed penalties for becoming compromised. while these increase the negatives and risks of a data leak it s all still important to remember that if you re in a regulated industry that likely means that the people you are selling into are going to care about security even more   and that s an opportunity to drive more revenue. don t just become hipaa compliant. use it to differentiate yourself. get a  rd party attestation implement strong controls talk about it in your messaging. the most boring brand advice about healthcare is blue is the color of trust . it s boring but there s wisdom in this. in healthcare you should be baking trust into even the colors you display to your users. if you re going to that level of extremes to convince potential users to use you then going beyond simply checking boxes to actually building a strong real world security posture is going to help you unlock more revenue. tldr on how to get ceo s to spend money on cybersecurity compliance. there s a great book called all marketers are liars and the moral of the story is that you can never get people to believe something new. you can only tell them what they already believe. i spend most of my days talking to ceo s founders about spending money on cybersecurity soc   iso       hipaa gdpr and more. i ll tell you a secret   i ve never been able to get someone to change their mind. if they see security as a way to prevent threats excellent. i love those conversations. but if they are focused on where do i invest my time effort and money to grow asap which in fairness is the   priority of most ceo s then positioning cybersecurity as a tool to help maximize that revenue has been one of the most impactful ways to talk about investing in security. if you re responsible for the security or compliance of your organization i hope something in here was useful in the pursuit of securing resources for

asyncrat. hope you find it useful  . lumma lumma is an information stealer developed using the c programming language. it is offered for sale as a malware as a service with several plans available. url capabilities: lumma has a range of capabilities including stealing sensitive data such as login credentials and financial details receiving frequent automatic updates gathering detailed data from browsers and cryptocurrency wallets and having the ability to drop additional malware. execution: lumma operates with a simple execution chain performing all tasks with a single process. it stops if it loses connection to its c c server. distribution: fake software phishing emails and discord messages.  . stealc stealc is a stealer malware that targets victims sensitive data which it exfiltrates from browsers messaging apps and other software. url capabilities: stealc gathers system info like ip address and os version evades detection using techniques like virtual environment checks and can drop additional malware such as laplas clipper. it also uses rc  encryption and base   encoding for obfuscation. execution: it typically enters via phishing malicious downloads or software vulnerabilities then establishes persistence to survive system reboots. using techniques like code injection it evades detection while stealing information such as login credentials or financial data. distribution: fake software sites phishing emails or loaders like crackedcantil lumma risepro and redline.  . asyncrat asyncrat is a rat that can monitor and remotely control infected systems. url capabilities: asyncrat allows an attacker to remotely capture the target s screen log and exfiltrate keystrokes import and execute additional malware extract files from infected systems maintain access and remotely reboot systems disable security software processes and launch botnet enabled dos attacks on targets. execution: the execution process is plain and straightforward just like a lot of other malware. this rat may make just a single process on the infected system or infects system processes. distribution: spam email attachments infected ads on compromised websites or dropped by other malware via vbs scripts. it can also be delivered through exploit kits.', 'am i hacked weird search query in clipboard perplexity ai auto form submit code as image etc... a strange occurrence

random search got into my clipboard and the weird automation of submitting things id be greatly appreciated. also i want to know if any of the below code or above instances sound like i might have malicious code running against my knowledge or on my computer. please don t be the person that keeps asking for additional information and for me to send comp specs and all of that. if you can t answer the question or point me in the right direction with just the information already provided then you are unable to answer the question if you think you might know what it might be and need more info you can just comment what you think it might be and what info your missing. just looking for you guys to share or mention your knowledge impressions on the occurrence that i don t have yet. so creatively and critically brainstorm on this and lend me what you can. again i m asking for help so that i can figure this out. not for anyone else to figure it out for me. though if you can figure it out exactly and post it without asking for additional info i ll be in your debt for sure. but any insight is greatly appreciated. thank you. i found this code in a strange tree under developer console

phishing spoofing and business email compromise . despite their critical role in securing communications protocols like spf dkim and dmarc remain misunderstood or underutilized in many setups. why spf dkim and dmarc matter: these protocols are the cornerstone of email authentication. they not only help protect your domain from being spoofed but also ensure that legitimate emails reach their destination. yet implementation challenges misconfigurations and a lack of awareness often leave organizations vulnerable. key takeaways from my experience:  . spf : this protocol works like a guest list for your domain allowing only authorized servers to send emails on your behalf. however many organizations overlook maintaining updated spf records leading to delivery issues or security gaps.  . dkim : think of this as a tamper evident seal for your emails. proper dkim configuration ensures that your message isn t altered in transit building trust with your recipients.  . dmarc : dmarc ties everything together giving domain owners control over how to handle unauthenticated messages and providing visibility through reporting. but moving from a none policy to quarantine or reject requires careful planning. common pitfalls and solutions: misaligned records: misconfigured spf or dkim can cause legitimate emails to fail dmarc checks. regular audits of your dns records are essential. ignoring reports: dmarc reports offer invaluable insights into how your domain is being used or abused. analyze them frequently to refine your email policies. underestimating human error: even the best protocols can t prevent users from falling for phishing scams. user education is a critical layer of defense. discussion: what s been your experience with implementing these protocols in your organization have you encountered challenges when trying to move from basic configurations to full enforcement i d love to hear your thoughts and share some insights from my own journey. additional resource: recently i compiled my knowledge into a comprehensive guide that explores these protocols in depth but without a technical jargon. if you re interested in practical implementation tips and

collecting code coverage you can effectively narrow down the sections of the binary to refine your understanding of the program. while dealing with a mips binary reversing challenge i came across a tool called cannoli which provides tracing capability in qemu user mode. it allows you to write plugins to trace execution paths and memory operations like read and write. what s most fascinating about this tool is not just what it does but how quickly and elegantly it accomplishes its tasks. in other words i was captivated by its engineering. the tool s author patched qemu to expose some of its internal functions allowing you to inject your own code into the jit code emitted by qemu for execution. this is achieved by providing two callbacks: one before an instruction is lifted and another before an instruction performing a memory operation is lifted in qemu. the real work is done by the code you inject into the jit code. this custom code exposes execution trace and memory operation data via ipc to another process which then post processes this data. essentially you ll be writing the data consumer library that is sent via ipc. the ipc design is also interesting. it uses shared memory based ipc where you allocate a large block of memory that is divided into smaller chunks. the idea is to use chunk sizes that match your cpu cache size to avoid cache misses thereby improving performance. the design supports a single producer and multiple consumers. a single write only chunk is available to the producer and once the producer is done it releases the buffer to be consumed. the consumers then post process the data clear it and release the memory chunk to be reused by the producer. one important thing to note is that this tool doesn t allow you to modify the behavior of the executing program it only allows you to observe the program s behavior. despite this it s still a very powerful tool. all of this is achieved by introducing about     lines of code into qemu. there s a lot more to discuss about this tool that can t fit into this small post. i would recommend checking out the project link and the blog post that discusses these tools in depth.

how you can get someone who is using a vpn and find their original ip. someone keeps visiting my website with the ip url and i know it s a vpn and wondered how i can find the original.', 'why is a vpn safer on public networks no really...why hello everyone. i have been working in cyber security for about   years now. i try my best to get down to the technical whys for practices whenever possible. something i have been researching off and on now for a month is the technical benefits of client focused vpn usage. i know the basics of how a vpn works pay for and use one personally because when i broke into the career field i always heard it was safer to use one. i have seen many many people say and post something like this i don t use a vpn at home but you should always use a vpn in a public network like a hotel or restaurant i realized last month that i don t necessarily know the why for this as much as i thought i did and my research online and discussions with others has not really left me satisfied. i was hoping to get some perspectives from people that have been in the industry for a bit. if i was in an untrusted public network i am tracking a couple risks:   evil twin   i connected to a malicious device and am going through them to make request now   compromised router   potential access to see my packets coming and leaving network   sharing a network with someone potentially malicious   i am sure they could arp scan and probe my device i am sure there are gaps in my knowledge as to why i am having an issue answering this so please let me know if there are things i am not considering as i hope to learn from this. for risk   and  : i ran some wireshark before making this post to spot check some of my basic understanding of tls before making this post. when i browsed to reddit it looks like i was indeed using tls. from what i understand most websites utilize https. if a bad guy was sniffing me out even on a public network they would see my clienthello which does contain the sni for reddit and my ja  information. after that all the application data is encrypted. so they would essentially know that someone with my private ip and mac establishing a tls connection with reddit. now in a more serious attack like evil twin i suppose there is the risk of getting sent malware from a legit mitm position depending if the website uses any unencrypted things like javascript files if i am solely relying on tls with no vpn. for risk  : i could be pinged and probed sharing a network with someone. with proper endpoint device security this doesn t seem too bad not ideal but the vpn does not fix this problem. me establishing a tunnel to the vpn server does not eliminate the fact that someone in my same network can try to interact with my private ip mac. these are the benefits of a vpn that i am tracking:   geolocation spoofing privacy   encrypted tunnel from client to vpn server. so if i browse to something that is not https my unencrypted web request will be inside the encrypted vpn tunnel on the way to the vpn server however the traffic from the vpn server to the http server will be unencrypted.   maybe its harder to strip encryption from a vpn provider than tls is there anything i am missing in the risks above or benefits of vpn usage within the context of an untrusted network. i am under the impression someone is probably fine if they are going to reputable websites even when on a public network. some snooper will just get a bunch of snis and anything else in that client hello and server response. i m looking to fill my technological gaps instead of just agreeing that vpn is good so safe . edit: thanks for everyone that participated in this discussion learned a lot of different perspectives and technical

you found some other secret file. you want to send the secret file to tom who worked in an undercover assignment in another city. you used a special lockbox with two keys you have a public key to lock the box and a private key to unlock it. so you used the public key to lock the box ensuring that only tom has a private key to unlock it. this is like asymmetric encryption: one key is used to lock the data and another key is used to unlock url the same time you ordered some special equipment related to their case over the internet. you used a secure website where the computer and website exchanged special keys to create a secure connection. this made sure that your payment information wasn t available to the criminal gang ensuring that only the website could read the details. this

sensitive data let s understand with the example imagine secure data inc. based in techville was renowned for handling millions of data. mystery surrounding the data security issue had been on an ever increasing spree. one fine morning the cto alex called for an urgent meeting. the challenge: team alex began we have to beef up our data encryption practices to protect our sensitive information from the ever increasing cyber threats. let s outline the best practices that we have to follow. strong choices of encryption algorithms: first alex explained we need to use robust modern algorithms such as aes with at least a     bit key. truly old algorithms like des are no longer secure. end to end encryption: the head of it jane added that data must therefore be encrypted at rest and in transit. that s to say whether the data is stationary or is in transit it s encrypted and thus protected from any unauthorized access. key management: according to the security specialist mark proper key management is everything. we should make use of a crypto key management system that is strong in features like automated key rotation and secure storage. periodically perform key rotation: speaking of key rotation alex noted we should regularly change our encryption keys. this minimizes the risk if a key gets compromised. access controls and authentication: access controls are very essential said jane. only authorized personnel should have access to the encrypted data and keys. we should implement multi factor authentication for added security. encrypting backups: mark reminded the team don t forget about backups. all backup data shall be encrypted to ensure that it stays secure in case the physical media are lost or stolen. assure conformity to standards: alex emphasized the emphasis on compliance. we should abide by regulations like gdpr hipaa and pci dss and thus be able to follow fgdpr hipaa and pci dss legal requirements while adhering to industry best practices. use data masking: for the testing and development environments we should make use of data masking jane suggested. that way sensitive information is anonymized while still usable for these purposes. staff education and training: training is important mark supplemented. we must regularly educate our workers about the practice of data security about the importance of encryption and how to treat encrypted data properly. monitoring and auditing: finally alex concluded we need to keep the access to encrypted data under close observation and regularly perform audits in order to identify and respond to suspicious activities. the result: by following these best practices secure data inc. significantly improved the security of its data. the team was confident that sensitive information was well protected. clients were starting to notice the improved security measures. by developing a robust encryption strategy secure data inc. has not only safeguarded critical data but has also worked to support compliance with industry standards in raising the bar on security for data in techville. learn more url', 'encryption for data being stored i made a similar rant on the subreddit page but wanted to post it here as well in addition to making slight edits to the wording. i am an it auditor and time and time again i see encryption that is implemented for data being stored but its at the disk level but not within the database so it s not even providing proper protection. i used to see a lot of entities that did not have any encryption implemented at all but then they started implementing it but went the hard disk type. its fine that this is there but the problem is this only protects data when the server is turned off or if the hard drive is physically removed from a server. in today s world most if not all attacks where data is stolen it happens logically rather than by stealing the physical media. hard disk encryption like bitlocker does not provide any protection if data is copied off a server logically. so i just don t understand why entities feel like they are fully protected even if they are not using any database encryption at all. hard disk encryption provides minimal protection at best. i understand there are modern applications out there that have yet to support it which that in itself is baffling to me. i know it can come down to cost and whatnot outside of the support of the application but still its crazy to me. the thing we like to see is something akin to tde or column level encryption that helps protect data from being read in clear text after a logical exfiltration of data to another computer. i also understand that the disk encryption basically just ticks off the encryption box for compliance purposes.']",training and

was unable. hopefully this doesn t bite me. also i read the faq and believe this is within the framework provided. i am not here to be swayed away from this nor will i be receptive to any attempt to add to the natural fear i already feel about recent and future events in my life. with that out of the way i come here asking for any advice tips tools secrets.. anything you have that will help me with what i am about to divulge below. i want to start this by saying thank you truly. i currently have a full time job that i am dissatisfied with. i make enough money to support myself and my family but at    years old it is starting to feel truly dead end. this feeling has been growing for some time of course as most things do and it is now to a crown. around a month and some days ago i was lying in bed incredibly ill. i was having fever dreams between episodes of charmed and for some reason or another began to ruminate on a recent experience in the workplace. my company along with thousands of others got caught in the cdk global ransomware event. it was chaos like i have never seen and it fascinated me. from there i began to think about other things that have happened in the workplace such as vendor imposters attempting to get pay card information smart key cloning and vehicle theft invoice fraud etc. somehow this left me with a business idea. before i could think further i m researching what business structure to use legal interests surrounding the type of work market research relative to the field etc. i reached out to a few businesses i have working relationships with and i m sitting here now with a two week trial run lined up that starts in a week. at the end of this run i will compile and present all data i have collected. if they like what they see i will be drawing up a contract and officially serving my first client on january       . i have already selected my llc name and dba. my mission statement is cemented and i have my presentation materials nearly finalized. i have the forms to register as a foreign entity in the home state of my prospective client as well as my domestic paperwork. i m fully in and still reaching out to other businesses. i am stupid but something is forcing me to keep doing this. i m in deep and i can t go back now. i have to keep going forward failure be damned. the business venture is pretty straightforward. it focuses on the human side of security. specifically social engineering and risk management. it will operate as a monthly service with opt in out programs suited for the businesses needs. throughout the month my business will try to collect information from the company through various means such as phishing phone calls fake invoices on site asset risks after hours penetration tests etc. through each action data will be recorded and compiled into a report consisting of gross risk divided by category. phone calls photos of risked assets like keys tools documents will also be included. positive reinforcement will be provided where the business does well and training will be offered to individual new hires and groups of existing employees when needed or requested. so of course with my reckless charge into starting a business in a field i have no business being a business owner in i enrolled into school. i will be attending snhu for a ba in cybersecurity with a concentration in data analysis. i am fully aware that this is an incredibly demanding career path intellectually. i fully understand that i have no understanding. i am a blank slate. the only advantage i have for myself is that i ve been playing with computers since i was a single digit child. i have very little programming experience aside from html css and a crappy language called blitz that i used to make a b tier pong clone. i am fairly good at math because i don t just memorize formulas i learn why they work which helps me retain the ideas behind what different types of data reflect. i know that this line of work is something i am capable of doing and feel i may enjoy. when i was in my early twenties i had no idea what i was doing and so i let my life stagnate. the last    years has been a blur but something has stirred in me and i can t stop it. i don t have any interest in stopping it either. i have never been this motivated nor this scared before. it is like something awoke in me. maybe it is because i went on a diet and got healthy this year or because i had an idea and some took me seriously. whatever it is i have no interest in walking away so if you can support me in my struggle to be

perspective and ideas about this situation. quick background: early   s graduated with a b.s. in cybersec a few years ago. final four semesters were also spent working as a student mentor for a government funded grant program given to my school to host a college level credit offering cybersec intro course for high school students . was hired shortly after graduation by my current company. began as an l  soc analyst for our at the time newly stood up managed service platform as an original member since day     so i ve seen it grow through all its ups and downs. both my company and our client pool consist of numerous world leading orgs in aerospace financial healthcare etc. industries. in terms of exposure have gotten to experience some pretty cool things in this regard. time spent here was obviously pretty basic ticket work but i personally liked to dive into things to the best of my ability which stood out. quickly earned a promotion to l  within the year which i found to be the spot felt like i was doing meaningful work was getting deeper hands on experience in client environments tools etc. and was being handed client requests and incidents for deeper work much of which received accolades. ticket work burnt me out too but a year or so later was given the bump to a lead role. this is where it began to stagnate. rarely do i touch security work anymore and i suppose that s just the course of things. but i want to do security...work now consists of all the behind the scenes bs that i m sure many of us are familiar with    meetings a day upper mgmt starting and stopping new projects every week senseless reviews and audits for busy work tasks that should be ahem cough automated it s just become a total slog. been at this role now for roughly     months and realistically the only way forward is yet an even more management heavy role which i do not want. management is not something i desire to do in any way i just know this about myself and have no interest in further moving into mgmt in any capacity. which brings me to this consideration to change careers. look into incident response threat hunt intel risk you might suggest. sadly have and unfortunately at least within my current company these are not viable. ir and threat are either outsourcing to our india teams explicitly or have a hire freeze in place. additionally they all route through each other in some capacity so without one it s basically impossible to move into another thus starts the loop again of need job for experience can t get job without experience. simply put i was essentially told it s not going to happen and do not have enough confidence that it will to wait around for it. this brings me to why i m staying: six figure remote work four day work weeks robust benefits and including holidays about   weeks pto year. it feels borderline stupid to even consider leaving but at what point does burnout exceed the benefits criminology interests me greatly and i ve considered school again to pursue a criminology forensics degree to tie into security. had basic exposure to law and forensics tools and processes in college nothing that i would list as meaningful for a job application but i highly enjoyed what i experienced. however i m very unfamiliar with that move process without some form of leo or law aligned experience. a note: i can get vouchers for sans and similar training through work assuming it fits my role but seeking unrelated training will throw up some flags. considered pursuing my gcih via sans as that fits my current role but also outreaches into others. at the end of the day i truly love my team and while i certainly don t hate my job it has become very unfulfilling. unfortunately feels as though my path either has me continuing at my company and moving into management which i do not want or seeking work elsewhere which i also do not want and therein lies the dilemma. leaving current benefits is ultimately the deciding factor or at least finding comparable. open to thoughts open to considering further education certs and training ideas are welcome. would love to get more than just do hackthebox or set up a lab to tinker and see what you like . if this would do better in the criminology sub i can move this there. thank for greatly your time.', 'dealing with feeling stuck in the security field opening statement in argument theory there s a concept of a false dichotomy. within a false dichotomy we assess that things can be good or bad. it s time to leave or stay. i m burned out or i m passionate. it

assess what s in the decimal points between   and   and hopefully some of the tricks and strategies will help you. tricks to be discussed:   challenge the status quo   diversify your value streams   intra preneurship why me before i start i want to give my obligitory why does my opinion matter . brutally honest   it doesn t. this is just some more text in the world that s repeating great things others have said before. ego inflating   i ve launched and sold a successful security start up worked for fortune   companies and i m an ex lifeguard at the ymca. disclaimers i m not a mental health professional and the advice i m giving should be taking with that in mind. there are mental health challenges temporary or chronic that may be associated with thoughts of being trapped into a situation. this advice is intended to be taken broadly and with a slab of salt. challenge the status quo i have yet to be in a single business where the processes were perfect everything worked like a well oiled machine and it was sunshine and rainbows. if you have a workplace like this and you re reading this article kindly go climb a tree. this is for the rest of us who live on earth. with the status quo often comes things like routine manual tasks that offer minimal value. there are standing meetings that don t make sense. there are boundaries that you aren t allowed to cross even though the fix is right in plain sight. it can entrap you into a box of function that feels self defeating in many ways. on the other hand... the status quo may come with such disorganized chaos that nothing is getting done. everyone complains about issues all the time but nothing is getting done about any of them. the backlog is so long and out of date that the thought of prioritizing and executing it requires mental stamina that only tibetan monks have attained. it s crazy out there. in either situation i find that a lot of people stuck in the status quo feel helpless to change things and don t feel like they have options. depending on the company that may be true but there are some things to try before giving up. in any situations where you are challenging the status quo it needs to be done with respect for why the tape is there. the best way to justify doing what you see as important is to understand the biggest pain points in the business and tackling them. this means talking with your management and other stake holders to see what s bothering them. once you have a good sense of the boundaries and challenges that exist you can start to put together a strategy for dealing with them. most boundaries are there for good reasons but sometimes they need to be adjusted. this is where a proof of concept comes into play. often times when i have an idea for a change the most effetive way to get support is to put something in a decision maker s hand that shows the change. this could be a script or a diagram or a spreadsheet it just needs to show the value you re bringing. an anecdote    once upon a time i worked at a large utility company and i m pretty sure the entire thing was built with red tape. i ve never spent more time or energy on documentation and process than i did at that organization so it definitely fell into the first status quo definiton. while my time there was cut short by a certain pandemic i was quite successful in my role ther and still have many good relationships from the role. what helped me succeed in the role was doing what i knew needed to be done rather than waiting for a process to complete. the project needed a script built and the devs were busy i wrote one. we needed to parse and analyze   gb of logs a day and i had a  th gen u processor to do it with time to learn rust. we needed a business primer on mfa methods i crafted one. we needed a financial projection for different solutions i built it. instead of being constrained to what my job title was i actively filled gaps and drove success. i prioritized the biggest pain points and allowed the noisy red tape to whine in the background unless it really was urgent. along the way i built the relationships with key people in the organization who also wanted change but needed help showing the path forward. on the flipside i had a colleague who was such a rule follower he genuinely struggled in his role. on top of that his manager was quite strict in his persuit of delivery. for months i watched the colleague flail about until one day i snapped at him. i pointed out that he wasn t likely going to be perfect at attaining all the written expectations for his role given the amount of tape. in that situation demonstrating value by completing work was more important than being perfect at following the red lines. when he let go of trying to do everything by the book and focus on getting things done he felt more empowered to do his job and was actually recognized for it. the manager who had been overbearing came to be trusting instead. diversify your value streams originally i had this section titled for income streams but i realize that was a single minded approach. in reality a lot of the times we feel stuck because we don t have other engagements in our lives. those could be side hustles hobbies or community work but they should all be something that keeps you engaged in something else. this excludes mindless activities that lead to less fulfillment such as watching tv. now i m not attacking watching tv. there s a time and place for sitting in front of the screen and getting lost in a story or catching up on the news. however activities like this or doom scrolling have been demonstrated to do little for our motivation and sense of fulfillment. in fact at too much exposure they can demotivate and defalte our sense of self. for me i have found the freelancing keeps me well engaged. i get to learn and solve different problems often for temporary clients so nothing to long or boring after a period of time. i ve also donated a lot of time to local non profits to support their it and provide teaching to those who want to get into the field. all these activities are outside of my work hours and keep me engaged by forcing my focus onto other activities for a while. note on the excuse of having families: i have one. four kids a disabled wife and all the extras that brings. as the single income earner for the family i do a lot to keep them taken care of but i still make time to play minecraft with the kids build legos build camp fires etc. with them. most of my side work is done early morning or after the kids go to bed. intra preneurship now some of you don t want to or aren t allowed to seek externaml work. in any case i highly recommend at looking in your business and seeing if there are opportunities for you to take on responsibilities that align with your career goals and business need. with the exception of large enterprises there s more hats to be worn than people to fill them. any start up people know this too well. in the small medium business category if you really need a change of pace but like the people you re with speak up. create a business case for the change and demonstrate how you could make a difference in that area. you may find that you re able to build your own brand within the organization as the person who brings positive change. with the reputational growth comes increased trust and opportunity to change the status quo drive value and make a fulfilling career of your own chosing within the organizatoin construct. if you want to learn more about this specific topic david bet patrick wrote a great book   steps ahead that covers this and more. i recommend it. in closing these are just three techniques for fighting your sense of being trapped or stuck. each of them allows you to create a decimal point between should i stay or go leading to options like:    . : leave    . : attempt intraprenuership    . : challenge the status quo    . : diversify value steams    . : stay good luck out there and remember that jobs are a major factor in life and they aren t going to make you personally fulfilled     of the time. it s not any company s job to make you happy as an employee and hr is there to make sure you re productive. this is all as it should be. your fulfillment and happiness is largely depenent on your ability to control your response to situations. these strategies will help and there are many others to choose from as well.']",workload and time pressure

platform requires you to be a company. any help would be appreciated edit: doesn t have to be free can be paid too.', 'is dark web monitoring actually valuable a quick list of use cases for cybercrime threat intelligence i see posts almost every day doubting the value of dark web monitoring or questioning whether vendors do what they claim. i work at a cti dark web monitoring company and feel it would probably be useful to clear up some confusion and also highlight several of the reasons that proactively monitoring the cybercrime ecosystem can be high value if done correctly. what do we mean when we talk about monitoring the dark web one of the big areas of confusion is that different vendors use dark web monitoring interchangeably while meaning very different things. generally the dark web is composed of sites accessible through tor . on many of these sites you will find large dump files containing password dumps. so what do vendors mean when they say they monitor the dark web : i d propose the following tiers to clearly explain dark web credential monitoring: they may be referring to simply monitoring credential dumps basic dark web coverage: they may monitor and archive some basic dark web forums credential dumps infiltration dark web coverage: the firm may monitor credential dumps while also infiltrating closed forums ransomware blogs and continuously archiving data from all tor sites that they are in. cybercrime monitoring: a huge amount of cyber crime today doesn t occur on traditional tor sites but instead is distributed across social media applications and instant messaging apps like telegram. companies conducting cybercrime monitoring are usually doing infiltration and dark web coverage monitoring telegram paste sites and other communities. x   b what is the actual security value in doing dark web cybercrime monitoring now that we have a basic definitions let s discuss the actual security value in monitoring the dark web. contrary to much popular belief there is a vast amount of actionable security data that can be gathered from dark web markets and forums. leaked credentials and password telemetry: this is the type of data you can get from haveibeenpwned but can be hugely impactful. credentials are a top attack vector in      and as it turns out users still set absolutely terrible passwords. proactively monitoring and remediating corporate credential leaks represents an impactful opportunity to reduce risk. this can be particularly valuable if you identify employs reusing the same password across multiple leaks as this makes them a primary target for threat actors. stealer log data from russian market and telegram: infostealer malware infects computers and steals all of the credentials saved in the browser. these are then sold on russian market and in public private telegram channels. these logs include credentials and session cookies to directly access corporate applications sso environments and dozens or even hundreds of credentials from the same user. company name mentions on prominent dark web forums: when threat actors identify confidential information that has been publicly exposed or breach a company they will often sell the data on breach forums exploit or xss. we ve seen several instances where a company was directly compromised or one of their subsidiaries were compromised and the data was then sold or given away on a dark web forum. ransomware blogs for third party exposure: ransomware blogs routinely publish corporate data as part of double and triple extortion schemes. given the nature of ransomware it is likely you will know if your company is a victim. however many organizations unwittingly have their information exposed that is possessed by third parties on ransomware blogs. proactively alerting to individual files contained in zip files on ransomware blogs can be enormously beneficial. initial access broker listings: initial access brokers hack into companies establish persistence then sell access to those environments in auction format . in some cases they will specifically mention the company they are selling access to in other cases they obfuscate it to avoid tipping the organization off and instead list general characteristics of the company such as revenue size etc. telegram: telegram boasts thousands of channels focused on cybercrime fraud hacking and ddos. in many cases threat actors will actively converse in public groups about companies they are planning to target and ttp s they intend to employ against organizations. exploits and vulnerabilities: if you have a fairly advanced team it can be useful to go through top tier dark web forums and look at new threat actor ttp s and exploits that are being actively discussed. while this is less directly actionable than other items on the list it can be invaluable particularly for large software companies or services providers. hopefully this provides some more insight into some of the main use cases and reasons to monitor the cybercrime ecosystem. happy to answer any questions that come up']",workload and time pressure

welcome any comments criticisms or opposing views. i would like to draw your attention for a moment to the topic of cloud exit. while this may seem unusual in a cybersecurity community i believe most organizations lack an understanding of the vendor lock in they encounter with a cloud first strategy and there are limited tools available on the market to assess these risks. although there are limited articles and research on this topic you might be familiar with it from the mini series of articles by dhh about leaving the cloud: url url   also found my topic suggestion to be worthy: url it s not widely known but in the european union the european banking authority is responsible for establishing a uniform set of rules to regulate and supervise banking across all member states. in      the eba published the guidelines on outsourcing arrangements technical document which sets the baseline for financial institutions wanting to move to the cloud. this baseline includes the requirement that organizations must be prepared for a cloud exit in case of specific incidents or triggers. due to unfavorable market conditions as a cloud security freelancer i ve had more time over the last couple of months which is why i started building a unified cloud exit assessment solution that helps organizations understand the risks associated with their cloud landscape and supports them in better understanding the risks challenges and constraints of a potential cloud exit. the solution is still in its early stages but i would be happy to share it with you for your review and feedback. the assessment engine is based on the following building blocks:   define scope exit strategy type: for microsoft azure the scope can be a resource group while for aws it can be an aws account and region.   build resource inventory: list the used resources services.   build cost inventory: identify the associated costs of the used resources services.   perform risk assessment: apply a pre defined rule set to examine the resources and complexity within the defined scope.   conduct alternative technology analysis: evaluate the available alternative technologies on the market.   develop report : create a report based on regulatory requirements. i ve created a lighweight version of the assessment engine and you can try it on your own: url example report   us: url example report   eu: url the example report used the migration to alternate cloud exit strategy which is why you can find only cloud related alternative technologies. to avoid any misunderstandings here are a few notes:   the lightweight version was built on microsoft azure because it was the fastest and simplest way to set it up.   i have no preference for any particular cloud service provider each has its own advantages and disadvantages.   i am neither a frontend nor a hardcore backend developer so please excuse me if the aforementioned lightweight version contains some hacks.   i m not trying to convince anyone that the cloud is good or bad.   since a cloud exit depends on an enormous number of factors and there can be many dependencies for an application my goal is not to promise a solution that solves everything with just a next next finish approach. many thanks bence.', 'parallel committees : a novelle secure and high performance distributed database architecture in my phd thesis i proposed a novel fault tolerant self configurable scalable secure decentralized and high performance distributed database replication architecture named parallel committees . i utilized an innovative sharding technique to enable the use of byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanisms in very large scale networks. with this innovative full sharding approach supporting both processing sharding and storage sharding as more processors and replicas join the network the system computing power and storage capacity increase unlimitedly while a classic bft consensus is utilized. my approach also allows an unlimited number of clients to join the system simultaneously without reducing system performance and transactional throughput. i introduced several innovative techniques: for distributing nodes between shards processing transactions across shards improving security and scalability of the system proactively circulating committee members and forming new committees automatically. i introduced an innovative and novel approach to distributing nodes between shards using a public key generation process called keychallenge that simultaneously mitigates sybil attacks and serves as a proof of work. the keychallenge idea is published in the peer reviewed conference proceedings of acm iccta      vienna austria. in this regard i proved that it is not straightforward for an attacker to generate a public key so that all characters of the key match the ranges set by the system.i explained how to automatically form new committees based on the rate of candidate processor nodes. the purpose of this technique is to optimally use all network capacity so that inactive surplus processors in the queue of a committee that were not active are employed in the new committee and play an effective role in increasing the throughput and the efficiency of the system. this technique leads to the maximum utilization of processor nodes and the capacity of computation and storage of the network to increase both processing sharding and storage sharding as much as possible. in the proposed architecture members of each committee are proactively and alternately replaced with backup processors. this technique of proactively circulating committee members has three main results: preventing a committee from being occupied by a group of processor nodes for a long time period in particular byzantine and faulty processors preventing committees from growing too much which could lead to scalability issues and latency in processing the clients requests due to the proactive circulation of committee members over a given time frame there exists a probability that several faulty nodes are excluded from the committee and placed in the committee queue. consequently during this time frame the faulty nodes in the committee queue do not impact the consensus process. this procedure can improve and enhance the fault tolerance threshold of the consensus mechanism.i also elucidated strategies to thwart the malicious action of key withholding where previously generated public keys are prevented from future shard access. the approach involves periodically altering the acceptable ranges for each character of the public key. the proposed architecture effectively reduces the number of undesirable cross shard transactions that are more complex and costly to process than intra shard transactions. i compared the proposed idea with other sharding based data replication systems and mentioned the main differences which are detailed in section  .  of my dissertation. the proposed architecture not only opens the door to a new world for further research in this field but also represents a significant step forward in enhancing distributed databases and data replication systems. the proposed idea has been published in the peer reviewed conference proceedings of ieee bcca     . additionally i provided an explanation for the decision not to employ a blockchain structure in the proposed architecture an issue that is discussed in great detail in chapter   of my dissertation. the complete version of my dissertation is accessible via the following link: url i compared my proposed database architecture with various distributed databases and data replication systems in section  .  of my dissertation. this comparison included apache cassandra amazon dynamodb google bigtable google spanner and scylladb. i strongly recommend reviewing that section for better clarity and understanding. i would greatly appreciate feedback and comments on the distributed database architecture proposed in my phd dissertation. your insights and opinions are invaluable so please feel free to share them without hesitation.']",incident response stress

i got a job as a developer in a company that develops cyber security solutions. i learned a lot regarding application security. i got so interested in cyber security that after year and a half i moved on to a role of application security engineer. i would do a lot research on application security topics did a lot of hacking and transferred the knowledge of cyber security to other developers so they would understand what the tool is actually doing what is it s purpose and similar stuff. i got a little bit of experience regarding the cloud aws to be specific. after that job i got better offer to

currently working in this company for about   years and i was really happy that i saw an opportunity that this company is really eager for security with the pursuit to be iso and soc  compliant. i saw myself as a medior who is yet to grow even more here. but then all of sudden that pursuit stopped from their end. a lot of budget cuts and similar stuff was going on and now i am afraid that they might cut off cyber security since industry that company is in is not regulated by any regulatory body nor does it require to be to put products out to market. i got to learn about every branch of cyber security. unfortunately i only got one certificate that verifies my knowledge and that is cc from isc . pursuing certificates requires a lot of spare time to learn everything that is needed but i am aware that only job experience nor only certificates are enough to be competent in this crazy market. i would like to tune myself to some industry that is mandatory to have cyber security to operate. i know that banking and medical industry requires to be cyber security compliant and reports are sent out more often to regulatory bodies than it is the case for other industries. please let

the idea of working in cyber without having to write code all day here are some roles you might want to check out:  . cybersecurity policy analyst this one s perfect if you re a bit of a research nerd . these analysts figure out how companies can stay on the right side of security laws and regulations. you re basically the person making sure everything runs smoothly from a policy perspective. not a line of code in sight.  . grc specialist i know the title sounds fancy but at the heart of it you re just making sure a company s security practices make sense for the business. no hardcore tech involved here just helping companies avoid fines and risks. it s a sweet spot if you re into risk management but don t want to get into the tech weeds.  . security awareness specialist this one is cool if you re into teaching. the job is to help normal people understand why they need to care about security. you d be creating training programs sending out tips and basically being the go to person to make sure the human side of the business stays safe.  . data protection officer i can t stress enough how much privacy and data protection are a big deal these days . as a dpo you d help companies handle personal data the right way. you re the person making sure they don t get into trouble with privacy laws. if you ve got a legal mind but aren t into the tech side this is your role.  . cybersecurity auditor ok this one s for the detail oriented folks out there. you d be the person checking that a company s cybersecurity processes are up to scratch. it s a bit like an investigator role but instead of code you re diving into their policies and procedures. not technical but you ve got to be sharp and thorough.  . cybersecurity project manager you know how some people are just really good at organizing chaos that s what a project manager does. you ll be managing security projects making sure they stay on budget and schedule. no coding required just solid project management skills.  . incident response coordinator imagine there s a security breach. everyone s freaking out but you re the one keeping things calm. you re not fixing the breach but you re coordinating the response making sure all the right people are working together to resolve the issue.  . cybersecurity recruiter here s a fun one finding talent. as a recruiter you help companies hire cybersecurity professionals. it s a great role if you re good with people and want to stay in the industry without getting technical. plus you get to learn about all the different cyber roles along the way. the best part about all these roles you don t need to be a tech genius to land them. if you re organized good with people skills there s a place for you in cybersecurity. have any of these caught your eye

it on the autism and move on with my day. however failing out of school made me revaluate things. i went to a psychiatrist and he said that i had pretty bad adhd and he had no idea how i made it through hs without the slightest inclination that something could be wrong . wgu is a online non profit nationally accredited university. wgu is different from typical universities as instead of paying for individual courses that make up a term you pay for time slot of   months. you can complete as many courses as you d like or do as little courses as you d like. i absolutely love wgu. it has completely changed my life for the better. wgu s cyber program that are included in the tuition price. so if you graduate you will have a degree from a national accredited university and industry recognized certificates. as much as i love glazing wgu lets move on with my journey. as soon as i enrolled i got a job as a home aid using my prior health care experience. my home aid job allowed me to to study at work for   hours a day as patients only really needed work done for one hour and mostly needed the convince of someone being around for the the rest of the time. in   months i got done over    of my courses for the four year program something that would not be possible in a traditional school. there is a lot of positive things about wgu i m leaving out so if you have any questions feel free to dm or comment. c. i got a it helpdesk job. this step sucked. through my research i quickly discovered that if i expected to just graduate and get a cybersecurity job with no problems i would be in for a rude awakening. most people recommended to get into helpdesk as a good entry point so i did school until i got my a certification and started applying. it took me     applications. at the time i thought this was insane but comparatively its actually not bad at all. i ve seen some people put in      and still be searching. interviewing was a relatively new thing for me. in health care you ll get hired if you have a pulse while in it i got ghosted after a a fourth round in person interview for a huge company in the city. after going into the city. after paying a    parking fee. cory if your reading this i hope your pillow stays warm at night. luckily for me the job i ended up getting in the end was probably one of the best ones i applied to. the pay was higher then average and the job was very easy so i spent most of my time there studying. i also got the chance to complete do multiple security projects which looked quite nice on the resume. d. i networked and attended local meetings. this step sucked worse. through further research i learned that the best way way to get a job is to know a guy. it also looks good on your resume if your apart of some cybersecurity groups. i really didn t want to do this as i was already working full time and in school full time at this point. i also haven t really been socially active since covid as covid really change my life for the worst. i used to enjoy going out but covid left me in a bad place physically and mentally. the only people i talked to were my family and my very close friends. however i knew that if i wanted to better myself eventually i would have to go outside and touch some grass. i looked up popular cybersec groups in my area and i went to two of them. the first one was formal. you would network before the meeting a sponsor would give a presentation on why you should buy their product and then it was over. i didn t particularly care for this one so much as there wasn t really to much time to network. everyone was also way older then me which definitely made it harder to connect with people in such a formal environment. you have to pay a yearly membership fee aswell. the second one was informal and meets at a bar in the city. they had a discord group which i joined and started talking to people from there. i posted my resume in the career advice channel and i immediately got invited to a voice call where two people critiqued it. after critiquing it they said it was overall pretty decent as i had   months of it work experience some good certs under my belt was active in some security groups and in school for cybersecurity. they told me that they will keep my resume if anything came up. i also went to their physical meetup and it was great. it was very nice to know they i still had it in me to make friends from strangers something i couldn t have done   months ago. the steps i was taking to improve my self were paying off. i also went to an annual cybersec conference in the city i already knew some people from my other groups and that was a cool experience. with all these steps being completed or in progress its time to talk about the job hunt.  . the job hunt itself. i got lucky. so lucky. stupid lucky. so lucky i should have bought a lotto ticket. i mean your going to need some luck with any job hunt you do but this was something else entirely. about a month ago i get a dm from the guy i was on the discord call with about my resume. he was leaving his current position and referred me to the hiring manager. while i appreciated the gesture i didn t think much of it as my resume had to to be good enough to get a call back. i m a pessimistic guy and assumed the worse. about four hours later i get a email from hr asking if we can schedule an interview. while doing all the steps before this moment contributed to this interview invite it was still very lucky that he left his position in the first place and it was very lucky that he referred me. with that being said luck can only take you so far. it was time to execute from this point forward or lock in as my fellow zoomers would say. by this point i was pretty good with interviews. the hr screening interview went perfectly. we had a great connection and i did flawlessly on the few technical questions that were asked. the hr person even scheduled my next interview during the middle of the interview. the next interview was with the director of cybersecurity operations. it was an   hour long with    minutes of straight technical questions. i m going to post the ones i remember below just to shed some light on what technical questions you could potentially see in some of these interviews:  . identify the following ports.  . what are the two types of encryption  . what s tcp  . what s udp  . how does dns work  . does dns use tcp or udp  . what s the mitre attack framework  . what s the cyber kill chain  . why would you use hashing   . can hashing be reversed   . what s the difference between a firewall deny rule vs a firewall drop rule   . what is a brute force attack and how can you mitigate it   . name the two most common vulnerability scanners.   . what is a mitm attack and how can you mitigate it   . what is a sql injection attack and how can you mitigate it   . what is the difference between a siem and an edr i got       of these questions right . i also tried to go the extra mile and give examples scenarios when i could. i thought the interview went good decent. we had good conversations but it was hard to get a good read on the guy. i also felt i did quite poorly on the behavioral questions that were asked so i expected the worse. the very next day the hr person called me and gave me an offer. in only    months from the start of my enrollment at wgu to this point my hard work had finally paid off. . i used to get caught up in job descriptions of jobs that interested me and pass up applying to a job if i didn t meet exactly what they were looking for . the consequence to this is that i only applied to a few jobs a day and the jobs i did apply to were almost impossible to get as the standards were lower so more people applied to them. one day i was catching up with my friend who was on leave from the marines. we were at a park and he went up to this women who was way out of his league and got her number. i have a hard time trying to talk to strangers much less do something like that. i asked him how he gets his confidence. his response shooters shoot. he was right. i needed stop thinking about if i was taking a high percentage shot and just shoot the damn ball. weather the shot was under the basket or from outside the arena . to get a job all you need is one place to say yes. the more applications you put in the higher chance a place will say yes. i started doing this and got more interviews. even if i didn t get the job this let me practice for interviews. it was also an amazing networking opportunity as you get to talk to employers in your desired field and get on a first name basis. these interviews can also be a great opportunity to get other positions as well. for example companies would tell me i don t think you meet the qualifications for the pentesting position but we we have soc opening that i think you could be a good fit for . the prior example happened to me   times.  . put a face to the name. when you apply to position from the employers perspective you are just name in a system. a name on an application that gets run to through an ai screening software that bases if your qualified for the position on keywords in your resume. when you apply to a role your particularly interested in it is worth the effort to reach out personally to the hiring mange subreddit . its harder to send some one an unfortunately email when the candidate connected with you on linked in and messaged you saying i m looking forward to to this opportunity    . in case you the recruiter doesn t immediately give you the job based on that message it s another good way to establish relationships with employers in your field of interest.  . leverage any resource you have to your advantage. by any resource i mean any resource. your friends mom works in hr at company of interest ask her if there s an opening. linked in allows     free connections a week connect with as many cyber recruiters and people who work in your dream jobs as possible. message them and and ask for tha    min coffee chat those linked in warriors always talk about . you have a phone start calling calling companies in your area and see if they have openings. use as many resources as you can to maximize your job hunt. if you are still reading this i appreciate the time you took to read this. i hope i have given you tips you can use or have entertained you at the very least. fell free to dm me with any questions : tldr  . make sure your are mentally prepared and healthy.  . acquire skills .  . network with others in the space.  . optimize your job hunt using relevant tips in tricks.  . do not give up.  . get lucky.']",frustration and helplessness

ip on our research platform what access control framework can we borrow ideas from we are redesigning our research platform that was mainly a monolithic software written in c with a lot of computational operators. individual users of our platform are teams researchers within the same company who can: a . create   code up their own operators in c and or b . write cfgs that make dags of those operators with customized parameters for desired outputs. this binary will be auto built via ci cd and run on cloud or prem in production with service accounts. now it s unclear whether we maintain a single copy of this monolithic binary that has all public proprietary operators compiled and loaded or each team user build their own binaries with their proprietary operators. if they don t have proprietary operators they will use the canonical version built with public operators. either way all production jobs need to be ci cd ed and run by dedicated devops engineers. the requirements are such that no one except the author of and not even the devops engineers that maintain the service account on the production server can read the source code of or the cfg specs of . here comes my list of questions. tia.  . the current idea to protect is to encrypt the cfg and deploy only the cipher text. the binary will decrypt and parse it in memory with a private key. but if the service account that runs production jobs needs the private key to decrypt it then the devops team can surely decrypt it some friend mentioned resource based access management on aws but we don t know how viable secure it is. from what i understand ram can ensure the private key on the server is only accessed by a job and not by the service account that runs the binary. i just don t know how to do this code wise outside a cloud setting.  . how do we ensure is viewable only to the author thinking about mandating the proprietary operators to be .so libraries so it can be dynamically loaded. but how do we make sure that it cannot even be loaded without authorization the solution might be similar to that of the  st question i suspect. i m certain our framework has a lot of flaws but so any advice is welcome. for one thing debugging the proprietary operators will be the responsibility of the authors and it has to carefully compartmentalized especially if we go with the route of a single centrally

a sql server hosted in aws which is used with primavera p  . the users connect via jdbc using a connection string . the catch is that the sql server cannot have a public ip all traffic must remain

must be extremely simple for them including setup ideally something like a on off button. for corporate clients the solution must align with enterprise it policies. for mobile users it must work seamlessly without needing them to configure complex network settings. right now i m considering a few options:  . aws privatelink seems like the most secure option for corporate users. however it requires their it teams to configure static routes or network routing to the vpc which might limit adoption. it also doesn t work well for mobile users who can t easily configure their networks to connect to the privatelink endpoint.  . https proxy is another option where traffic is encrypted over tls and forwarded to the sql server. this would provide a single connection point for both corporate and mobile users but the proxy would technically be public facing even with authentication methods like client certificates or basic auth.  . wireguard vpn could be a great lightweight option with an easy on off client interface for mobile users. it s cost effective and secure but might require corporate it approval which could be a roadblock. i like that it supports split tunneling so only traffic to the sql server would go through the vpn.  . ssh tunneling is another option but feels too complex for non technical users. while tools like putty or mobaxterm could simplify the process it still doesn t feel like a good fit for users who just need a one click solution. my dilemma is finding a solution that balances enterprise security for corporate users with ease of use for mobile users. it also needs to be cost effective managed vpns that cost    per user is too much like on aws as the number of users is high. and i feel getting certain things past corporate it and

example consider this scenario:  . you are hired at a corporate role in an office environment.  . you in your own time go out of your way to do some extra work and develop create a number of useful documents for the company organisation e.g. policy or procedural documents work flow guides cheat sheets presentations on various topics etc. these documents are useful and used by others at your workplace with them having been made accessible by you on some kind of shared access repository folde subreddit management system etc.  . you are suddenly unfairly dismissed say for example s sake off the back of some false allegation of misconduct etc. etc.  . in this instance would it have been possible to have created documents which have built into them some automatic process such as self encrypting etc. this would be to function as a kind of fail safe protective mechanism built into your ip hard work so that it can t be hijacked unfairly by others. i m no programme subreddit  bro and so have no real idea of the limitations of what is and isn t possible in this regard... but as i see it you must be limited by a combination of two primary aspects:  . the file type and their built in macro type functions and  . the company s own internal computer network system s security settings . random ideas i d thrown up:  . for example some kind of macro scripting inside of a word document that checks the windows systems date time each time it s closed if after date time x then set password y etc. of course this i believe might mean that macros have to be enabled on that particular user s profile windows settings allowed by the company network etc...  . a kind of hyperlink built into a document that upon opening of said document ideally automatically runs and reaches out to some external resource e.g. website serve subreddit storage etc. and depending upon what it does doesn t find at the other end carries out a resulting action on its end and changes the document . e.g. pdf gets opened automatically reaches out to some website url or web server and reads a .txt file sitting on there: if it reads the word keep on that .txt file it does nothing and keeps the same password to itself it already has. or otherwise if it reads the word change on that same .txt file instead it automatically updates the password to itself with a new password etc. etc. so... this kind of thing

a grain of salt as what i know may not be     true. also disclaimer: this post is not to criticize hak  o.mg or ridicule their staff but rather to point out the potential danger posed from anyone who intend to use one of their products for malicious intent. i am sure they mean well as their products are made to help improve the security of companies and software products.   it s a bit of a rare topic to talk about when it comes to cybersecurity and i think it deserves more attention especially since hackers are becoming more clever with hardware. url i came across this youtube video by linus tech tips where he talks about a special type of cable known as o.mg cables. they sound terrifying because they are replica cables of the ones officially sold for iphones and android devices. these cables at first glance look normal and exactly like the ones you d plug into your phone but are actually hacking devices. inside the usb end of the cable is a small compact wi fi connector that uses the wi fi your device is connected to allow remote access to it. once plugged in a hacker immediately has remote access to your phone and it automatically keylogs everything you type allowing the hacker to read everything you are saying including in chat messages with other people and even see your logins and passwords. i ve been doing research on these things for the past two weeks now and as a guy who travels a lot either to college or general public i even started to wonder if my cables were replaced at some point by somebody unknowingly. it was just simply out of fear and imagination though and i m pretty sure they re still the same cables i ve always had and used plus i m sure i would ve noticed if somebody replaced them or tapped into my phone but i am keeping a close eye on my cables from now on. now i want to clarify what i m about to say is pretty much already covered in linus and other youtube videos but i felt it necessary to spread word with more detail as possible. throughout my research i found out these cables are sold by a company called hak  who sells a bunch of hacking devices to red teams it departments corporations police departments government agencies or people in general to help improve security systems and patch out vulnerabilities in software. this is their website here: url no it s not some black market scheme these are legally sold. i know the media usually portrays hacking in a dark tone whether it s on a fictional tv show or video game or news outlets explaining the dangers of hacks but not all hacks are malicious as the media portrays as already mentioned they are sometimes done to help find vulnerabilities to be patched. if you re into cybersecurity or a tech enthusiast like me you may have at one point heard of the wi fi pineapple a device used to find holes in a public wi fi and eavesdrop on people or the usb rubber ducky a device made to look like a normal usb flash drive is actually a small computer that loads hacking payloads onto pc s. these are actually products of hak . the o.mg cable basically does the same thing as the rubber ducky but it s harder to detect since it was mainly made for smartphones and they re often detected as keyboard or mouse peripherals which is usually the method of bypassing. they are indeed intended for smartphones but in some cases i heard it can also affect computers too. in case you don t know what a payload is it s basically a script or a piece of code written by a hacker made to cause the target system to do things without the need of its intended user such as commanding the compute subreddit to open the default web browser and immediately go to a malicious website to download malicious files. another reason why o.mg cables and their payloads in particular are harder to detect is because the payloads are written in a unique coding language made for the o.mg cables. the o.mg cable isn t actually made by hak  but rather a product they sell in cooperation with another company that being o.mg. now i know what some of you iphone users may be thinking: what s the big deal just update your iphone and don t jailbreak it oh my friend you have no idea what this thing is capable of. the o.mg cables are regularly updated with various updates and new payloads are shared amongst people who use hak  sold products and o.mg every once in a while releases a new model of o.mg cables. just last month as of the time of this post they released a new version: url the good thing about cables like these whether they re o.mg or generic malicious cables because there are some that have existed before o.mg ones is that they are rare and hak  sells o.mg cables at a minimum of     usd. you re most likely to see one of these things left on the ground at corporate offices or government agencies where hackers might attempt to breach and obtain vital company or government information by hoping someone working in those fields will pick them up and think they re benign devices. now that doesn t mean that anybody who has a hold of one of these things won t try to hack into a random individual s device. however if you are somewhat worried whether or not your usb cables are legit or not there do exist software and devices that can help you ease your worries most notably usb data blockers. these small usb devices were made to block out data transfers but allow power to pass through them making it safer to even use public chargers that the fbi and other law enforcement agencies keep telling people not to use . there s plenty of them out there but the most popular choices i ve seen are the following:  juice jack defender  portapow usb data blocker  charger defender  gosund usb data blocker  usb condom  the databloc  jsaux usb data blocker o.mg even made one themselves because the wife of the guy who made the o.mg cables got tired of trying to figure out which cables they had in their home were o.mg cables and which ones were genuine charger cords. according to the webpage on hak  and o.mg s instruction manual for the product this not only blocks data but also there s an led indicator to alert the user that the cable is attempting to connect to wi fi or perform actions other than charging so good thing they made such a product: url if you re wondering whether or not your cable may be malicious and for some reason you cannot get ahold of a device or software that can help you find out here are some things and some signs to know if your phone is hacked especially by one of these:  . you may already know this one but one of the first well known obvious signs is that your battery is draining fast. this is because your phone or device is being forced to do extra work so that the hacker maintains access to your phone.  . another well known and obvious sign is that your device is heating up even without you using it. this ties in with   where the device is doing extra work to keep the hacker connected.  . your web browser suddenly opens a web page you didn t even intend to open. the keyboard is also acting on its own to make this happen.  . your device suddenly installs an app that you don t even remember installing.  . probably the scariest one is that your device suddenly sends texts or messages to others you don t remember sending or the phone suddenly takes a photo from the camera or screenshot of what s currently on the screen and immediately sends it to an unknown contact.  . if you re using an iphone it should be un jailbroken. being jailbroken means that your iphone can download unauthorized apps and run files that are not approved by apple and published in the appstore. apple keeps the iphone un jailbroken and sandboxed to ensure the safety of the user and to make sure ios is as secure as possible and the only software that you can download to your iphone are the ones approved by apple. if you find that your iphone is jailbroken and you did not intend for this to happen this means a hacker had somehow tapped into your phone and uploaded malicious code to jailbreak itself so that the hacker could do more damage to it by making it download unauthorized files. note:     and   are signs that payloads were executed onto your device. as mentioned before these are scripts or at least pieces of code that were unknowingly sent by the hacker and executed so that the device performs actions that were not intended by the user and could most definitely be an indication that something you plugged into your phone is malicious. these are some of the more well known signs of malware or hacks present on your device and it may be best to check and see if your cable or whatever you may connect to it may be responsible. but what should you do if you believe the cable you currently hold is malicious here s some steps i came up with:  . throw it away or if possible turn it in to police department. throwing it away may sometimes or most times be the better time saving option because oftentimes a malicious cable has a self destruct feature. don t worry i do not mean it ll blow up and cause physical harm to you. what this means is that the hacker can put in a command that ll tell the cable s computer components to delete everything it may have stored onto itself and fry the electronics turning it into a normal charging cable and leaving no traces in the code as to who was hacking you. the hacker no longer has access to your device or can control the cable afterwards but you should still throw what s left in the cable away even if they could or did self destruct it. so when throwing it away and i recommend wearing rubbe subreddit  conductive gloves if you feel the need to do this cut the wire in half or in pieces with a pair of scissors flush cutter or a knife and dismantle the connectors on both ends the usb connector and the lightning usb c connector this can be done by either crushing the shell and pulling the components apart with some strong pliers or and a bit of a dangerous method smash it with a hammer. i don t recommend the latter though as the internal pieces could go scattering and end up somewhere you can t find or get to them. if you can and it s recommended anyway dispose of the now dismantled cable in an e waste bin. the reason we want to tear it up like this is so nobody else falls victim to the cable.  . replace your wire with an official wire from retail such as best buy walmart or even an apple store or a phone service store like t mobile verizon etc. don t buy a cable off of ebay since most of the times those are just random sellers who are not affiliated with a business and there s a chance they might have tampered with it in some way and secretly turned it into a malicious cable . if you intend to buy a third party cable online especially from amazon do research first see what people say about the particular cable you are about to buy whether it s youtube reviews or reviews on amazon. i don t know anything about android cables unfortunately since i ve never owned an android phone but for iphones definitely look for a cable that s mfi certified. mfi certified means that the cable product was checked and verified by apple themselves and they confirmed it safe to use.  . factory reset or download an av app for your device if the hacks and possible malware continue to persist even with the cable gone. if you have an android phone it s definitely possible to download an av off of the google store. definitely find one with good detection rates and a firewall. i usually recommend the following for computer users and they could be just as good on android if they are available: bitdefender kaspersky eset malwarebytes and sophos. for iphone users i hate to say it but you re most likely going to have to backup and factory reset your iphone. because of the nature of the iphone and apple s strict policy and sandboxing doesn t allow true antivirus software onto iphone. you ll see many av companies make apps for iphone but these are mostly jailbreak checkers and vpns. factory resetting is usually the way most iphone users go to remove malware hacks payloads and even reverse jailbreaks on an iphone. even then apple usually does great job at patching security exploits so if you don t want to do the factory reset try checking for updates for ios or simply turning off and on your iphone again to see if that removes any problems first.  . lastly and very simple. keep your device s os and apps up to date. especially if there s a major update download and install it. consider a vpn for extra security if you feel the need. if the steps above don t work it s probably best to go see a cybersecurity or computer expert. at the very least you should definitely change any the passwords and set up   factor authenticators for any and all accounts that were logged in onto your device through a non compromised one. that s all i have to say for this post. i simply wanted to bring attention to malicious usb charging cables and give out some tips on whenever and if ever you came across one and you may have infected your smartphone device with one of these. i m sure hak  and o.mg mean well since their products are mainly done to pentest security systems and seek out vulnerabilities to help companies and people patch up their systems. the o.mg cables have been around for some time about four years now they even come in different models that aren t smartphone replicas such as a usb to usb c adapter though the smartphone replicas are much more prevelent. while it is a bit rare to see a hardware based attack these days with tight security amongst corporations and people being more weary of their surroundings i still felt it necessary to make this post and i hope it does potentially help someone in the future.']",incident response stress

shockingly economical. for example spending       to hire a hacker or private investigator equipped with ai tools could lead to a        raise or career boost. these professionals could: monitor someone s activity summarize irregularities or interests and intercept or even alter communications. encrypt or self destruct their methods making the hack untraceable. provide social leverage by uncovering a victim s weak points enabling their client to win arguments mirror personal interests to unsettle them or spread damaging information. what makes this even more concerning is how unlikely formal investigations could be. subtle hacks wouldn t involve stealing large sums of money or committing identity theft the kind of incidents that make headlines or demand immediate attention. instead the fallout is psychological: missed opportunities emotional exhaustion or diminished confidence. victims could feel like they re unraveling instead of suspecting external manipulation. could this be more widespread than we think how many people might already be victims without even realizing it', 'community opinion: practicality and ethics of kernel level anti cheats poll question upfront: what do you think about the use of kernel level anti cheats in video games i recently reignited this topic after helldivers   dropped and discovered it had kernel level anti cheat which seemed ridiculous for a pve game. i ve searched and found there hasn t been an organized discussion which is surprising considering i m assuming most of us are gamers in some capacity. so i wanted to kick the tires here and see what everyone has to say. the implementation of klac has pretty much been adopted by most aaa games and studios for pvp based games but even some pve games have begun to implement it too. my question to the community is probing the aspect of what we think of klac as professionals and the watchers who are often both part of the teams who secure the applications and the users vested in security at home. i come from a background of mostly government soc analyst and engineering work. the perspective i maintain is that while the balancing of the game is vital the cost of privacy feels too high for me to invest myself in titles that leverage klac . while companies can all but guarantee the safety and security of our privacy there isn t actually much of anything that binds them to that and employs self governance instead. what s worse are the growing supply chain attacks we see all it takes is one threat actor to inject a malicious update that the anti cheat takes and runs and boom good rootkit gone bad on who knows how many systems. not to mention the stability issues users widely report having when installed. i can try to see the perspective from the other side. maintaining the sanctity of the game essentially its integrity is vital to keeping games fun and accessible. thus the risk reward favors allowing it so that people can just go about their day and enjoy their hobbies with less interference from people who seek to tamper with it. and what really is the risk should we suspect kernel level software will be attacked and used to deploy malware i feel that s so easy to counter though as aren t we all taught that it s not a matter of if but when or is this truly a tin foil hat kind of thought process i d love to be critiqued if people think otherwise. another random thing to consider is the adoption of ai in cheats. just recently at ces they showed off a monitor that could provide real time in game assistance to players giving them an advantage. this kind of thing has undoubtedly opened up cheat makers minds to break into and take advantage of meaning even klac won t stop them unless devs outright ban the model id of the monitor and won t let you launch the game with it on . i d honestly like to convince myself that i m just overthinking it and that klac isn t as bad as it seems my gut instinct about everything i know professionally makes me feel super uneasy about it all. one thing we of course don t see is klac actively working and getting statistical feedback from devs that compare pre klac to now and how its improved the quality of our online gaming communities. that may be able to justify it at least for some of us. if my worst fears are true though how can the community combat devs from implementing klac url']",incident response stress

at the same time as the three emails from binance regarding my failed verification process . this timing was enough to convince me that it was binance contacting me and not scammers. the fact that the scam message was sent immediately after my failed verification attempts on the binance application indicates that the scammers had access to sensitive personal information including my contact details. this breach of data privacy raises serious concerns about the security of personal information. continuing with the sequence of the scam in july i received a second sms notification from binance indicating that a login to my account was detected from paris. the message instructed me to contact binance immediately via a german landline if this activity was not initiated by me. this second sms was part of the actual scam. . upon contacting the provided phone number i was connected to an automated system in german that instructed me to press   if i had a binance account. following these instructions i was connected to an individual who falsely represented themselves as a binance agent. this person claimed that binance had been hacked and customers were panicking asking me to remain on hold for    minutes while they assisted another client who had been hacked for several million. during a call that lasted    minutes the individual advised me to transfer my funds to a secure wallet using the trust wallet application. following the scammer s instructions i downloaded the trust app added an existing wallet and received a secret phrase via sms. secret phrase was: . when i received the sms containing the secret phrase i intended to read it aloud to him. however he firmly advised me not to do so emphasizing that these phrases are highly confidential and should not be shared with anyone even a binance agent. this warning made his request appear very credible to me. please see the attached screenshot. following the scammer s instructions i split the transactions

afterwards they requested my bank account details linked to my binance account which raised my suspicions. the scammer then placed me on hold and transferred the funds to another wallet resulting in a

purchases but i was instructed to not do anything about it by my gm orders giving the customer the benefit of the doubt. i need advice on how to act in this matter as i believe this is a cybercrime and needs to be reported to the authorities. good morning everyone i am new on this subreddit and i will try to be as concise as possible with my issue. i work as an it at a grocery store and we have an ecommerce version of our brick and mortar where we sell our store branded e giftcards. we are located in california and our city is a big college town with lots of international students. this information is to give you context on what is going to happen at the end. around march our cfo was running a report and noticed that multiple e gift cards had been cashed out in our store. so he logged on to our credit card processor dashboard and noticed that we had some credit card disputes and that there had been multiple attempts of failed purchases in the same week. he contacted me to look into the issue and after some research i found that there was a pattern to these failed transactions that went back to january and that during those attempts this person had succeeded in purchasing multiple gift cards from us. this person had been trying multiple credit card numbers using actor names as the main cardholder name which made it more suspicious. most of the purchases and failed attempts came from the same   ip addresses which made it easier to find. so i pulled our database logs to match the purchased e giftcard numbers and combed through our transactions to find out if they had been used. i found out that one of them had been used and i crossed reference the date and the register number i pulled the camera footage to find the face of the person who had been purchasing the gift cards. this person started by buying a        and     gift cards and used them until they got to a bit under    dollars to cash them out claiming that their parents had bought him the gift cards to buy groceries but that he needed that cash and didn t want to burden their parents by asking them for more money so he just wanted to get the remaining cash back. also for reference in california customers can get cash back from their remaining balance from any gift card as long as it is under   . if it is exactly    dollars then they cannot cash it out. after that first trial he started buying multiple e gift cards valued at    and others under    dollars and started coming into the store during different times of the day and with different cashiers and started asking for cash back. he told all the cashiers the same story but some of the supervisors were suspicious of them cashing   or   cards at once yet they did it anyway. this is what prompted this investigation becuase of the report that our cfo ran had multiple cashouts in one week. this is the part where i need the help. after i did my investigation and presented it to our cfo and my gm i suggested that we report him to the police or the fbi and revoke their membership. my cfo was on board but the gm was not. this person committing fraud had joined our store as a member too and my gm didn t want to upset the customer because they are a student and they said it was their parents buying the gift cards. i told my gm that if that was the case then why did their alleged parents report the purchases as fraud multiple times and why did the original credit cards were from different states she argued that people have more than one credit card nowadays and that they might have masked them to hide their real credit card info i also showed her that the purchases happened with ip addresses in our hometown and some of those addresses came from the local university ip address and another city nearby . all of them were being sent to the same email address. she told me that it was not my job to patrol what other people do and that i should not waste my time doing these investigations and if they were fraudulent the credit card processor would probably investigate. i contacted our credit card processor and said that they couldn t do anything and the best i could do was to block the ip addresses and set more aggressive rules which i did. it had been working for   months but he is back at it again with a new ip address. i ignored my gm and continued investigating and have been saving all the evidence i can and even saved the email that my gm sent me saying that i shouldn t do anything. we lost the credit card disputes . so what should i do what are my obligations as the it of the store when it comes to these matters my cybersecurity training and instinct says to go behind my boss back and email the fbi to do an investigation. what would you all do if you were in my shoes i am so upset to see someone stealing in front of our noses and not being able to do anything because my boss instructs me not to do it yet i know this is not right especially since i suspect that these person is stealing credit card info . they have purchased at least     worth of e gift cards.']",incident response stress

ladder not really an entry level thing in most cases. lots of knowledge is needed in the it field as a whole. programming bootcamp per say is more directed to a specific skill as cyber security is a vast array of accumulated knowledge most people who have taken a bootcamp say it s not worth it some who ve taken a bootcamp say it worked but i noticed this was a number of years ago some good boot camps but a lot are subpar or even scammy make sure if you do a bootcamp do one that offers assistance getting a job a degree will give you more knowledge and more options as a whole use transferrable skills as a direction so as to not have a fully cold start when in the interview process networking and connections are super important x   b comment that i found kind of wrapped up the general consensus. user any guided training that provides structure will always be helpful. but for the amount of money they charge no. x   b hypothetical pipeline. some people say it takes years others got lucky. experience work in it field while getting certs security knowledge google cert imb or equivalent analyst secops work into engineering x   b resources hackthebox.com and tryhackme.com have courses are up to date and are interactive wgu.com offers online degrees john strands pay what you can antisyphontraining.com pay what you can  ngos that may help x   b edit  : thanks to everyone that took their time and commented i really do appreciate all the info and didn t expect to get so much thanks again i need a job that can be done remote and provide flexible hours all the while to pay enough for medical bills and rent in move out of california. unfortunately this kind of a job everyone wants as it would be nice but its something i need due to my limitations. the allure of promised work with my resume collecting dust is some good bait for these boot camps hahaha. basically it sounds like i need to be looking at actual entry level jobs instead of the false entry level cybersecurity job. i ll see what i can do getting a help desk it job and get experience certs at the same time. sounds like if i go the degree route though i ll definitely need a bachelors to be able to compete. honestly i dont think i have it in me and i dont think i can afford the time. think my real option is to wait for the dor to get back to me or if there is some other assistance for the disabled. hopefully there s another route i have missed. once again thanks for all the comments and a good dose of reality from people who have actually done these boot camps and who work in the industry. edit: wow this got approved in my sleep hahaha. thanks for all the replies i m just starting to go through them hey i apologize for redundancy but wanted to ask the same question but with some personal context. i recently became disabled and after some years i m getting back on my feet. the repercussions of my disease though is my current profession and a lot of other career fields are not an option. after a lot of deliberation considering my age a career in something more digital seems like the best option. on the waiting list to talk to the department of rehabilitation. i m not looking to make serious bank or anything but just get a job really haha. there s a lot of positive reviews about boot camps but many posts and videos about how they aren t worth it. i m not a luddite but i definitely need to learn the basics. in a case like i m in would a bootcamp be a more worth while endeavor spending   years for an associates or bachelor would be tough in my position due to time but if it s drastically more worth while then i ll have to consider it. would love to know if anyone has some sage advice or suggestions. thanks']",organizational constraints and bureaucracy

say. i work for a great company. they generally meet all of my needs. my position primarily focuses on detection engineering and incident response with hints of cross functional support depending on the business s needs. but when my boss the ciso asked where i see myself in   years i couldn t give him an answer. of course he told me to get back to him on that but i ve thought about it regularly since i finished my bachelor s degree toward the beginning of     . after that conversation though i realized i didn t know. overall i m surrounded by great leaders. i m on the security operations team reporting to the director but generally we do the same kind of work. we also have the network security team and the risk and vulnerability management team. i could pivot but i felt as if the question was more along the lines of what s your next wrung on the ladder i don t really know. i ve never had a mentor in this space and this is the first position i ve had in a large company with a team this big. it s always quite literally just been me. i started as the sole desktop support at my previous company and took over after my manager left as the system admin. so i was always making most of my own decisions and goals and paving my own way. even starting my first security job it was just me next to the other sa s and the network guy. now i work beside roughly    other bright talented security professionals. but i am still trying to figure out what i want to do next. i don t even know how to figure it out. is it even a question worth answering maybe i m right where i am   years from now and maybe then i ll figure out what i want to do next. i don t know. i gues this isn t really a question but more like a stream of thought out into the   subreddit void. i m hoping perhaps someone else has been through this and figured it out.', 'being seconded guessed i apologize if this comes across as a rant. that is not my intention. some background: i ve been a security lead engineer on a small team for a big company for a few years. stuff wasn t that bad. just a lot of paperwork for a product the team and i were working on. although i am the security lead i m not the development lead. the development lead is a boomer that has worked for the company for a long time. same with our manager. boomer that s worked majority of his career there. i try to put my best foot forward when it comes to security. i suggest we do certain things but most of the time it s rejected by the manager stating it s fine as it is. there have been some incidents in the past where i know for sure i was seconded guessed on security things. example we needed to run black duck on the code. it was already setup by another person so it was just a matter of pressing a button to start the scan. after i gave my manager the generated report he had someone else rerun the scan to verify it. i eventually talked to him about it and i had thought we worked it out. a couple more smaller incidents occurred afterwards. i talked through them with him and it seemed like we were ok. fast forward to last week. one functionality didn t work. dev lead traced it back to a change i made months ago. what happened was we were supposed to kick off a release but one nuget package from a dependent repository was breaking the pipeline. i checked it out and it had a transient package that seemed very suspicious. black duck even flagged it although this dependent repo wasn t part of the release. i swapped the nuget package with a more trustworthy one and that fixed the issue or at least i thought. dev lead wasn t happy with me and decided to put the nuget package back in. both he and my manager kept asking me for a week why i made the change. i kept telling them the same thing. this nuget package doesn t seem trustworthy and it was breaking the pipelines. dev lead chimed in and said i got the pipelines to work. i pushed back and said we should try to use the trustworthy one. as always i get told by my dev lead if you don t like the change come up with a solution. ok i ll take a look at it. manager butts in and says if it works now let s leave it in. am i overthinking this and in the wrong or am i being second guessed again i m honestly questioning whether this is either an age or gender issue with how many times something like this has happened.', 'clueless leadership throwaway account and yes some grammar is funny because i m leaving out information on purpose. i know there is a stereotype of executive leadership not being real security folks in larger companies that have dedicated c level information security representation but i am curious what your thoughts are on my scenario and what people experience with smaller companies who may only have director level responsible for security. first off my background i got into cyber before the recent boom i between      years of cyber experience in various positions. i certainly know i have plenty left to learn and by no means am i a business expert but i would say i confidently understand most of the business side of cyber. the current position i m in i work as a team lead for a team of   security engineers   contractor who report to me. now to discuss my situation i report to a manager who reports to the director. my direct manager is fine he s a seasoned veteran running a dfir team but he doesn t do a lot of business stuff and is not who i interact with most often. the director has   technical security experience and worked mostly as a outsourced network support and physical compliance auditor until this current role. they acts as the ciso . unrelated but why is that such a common thing i have had   different bosses who both were not cisos but called them self that and put that on linkedin. given the director has little to no security experience i feel i do a lot of their security work. i perform all the security reviews risk assessments and approve things they copy and paste my assessment into their reply emails. i draft    of their emails to the board executive team any technical questions i always draft for. all quarterly reports to the board executive team is crowdsourced by the greater team. i don t have any experience elsewhere but i find the fact that they create   of the slides odd. let alone the fact that because    people are working on this the presentation looks like shit but they are also insistent on putting books worth of irrelevant text on the slides. i would think the director would work to make their presentation and get the information from the team instead of them making the slides. another item which i find annoyingly odd is that they insist the security team do nothing in relation to incidents for example if we were to get notified of an info stealer malware on a server the only thing the security should do is create a bunch of paperwork to track it then notify the team they should remove it and request updates every so often. i don t have much experience designing ir plans but in my opinion the security team should be running the show and utilizing all of their tools to their maximum potential not just being a project manager in charge of getting update from people. one last tangent like many companies we have restricted travel for executives only however they have convinced the purse holders that they must travel to   different countries each quarter for compliance reasons. not an expert in compliance but given their trips randomly get canceled and never rescheduled i find it highly unlikely it s required for compliance. at face value it feels to me like they have very little security knowledge and are trying to get by as a ciso. the board executive team had very little security exposure until recently and did not question anything they were told. i will mention that they absolutely deal with the budget but i would imagine a ciso is much more than an excel file. i also understand there s a lot of politics that goes into running an department so by no means am i saying they do nothing but they re online maybe     hours a day. i believe i have been pretty well compensated but am i being compensated like this because i do a lot of my boss s job or just because im good at my own is this normal in the cybersecurity field should i search for a new job or look out to potentially get a career boost out of it tldr my boss does not have security experience i do most of their security related work but ive been promoted several times more than what i believe is usual. am being promoted to help my boss x   b']",incident response stress

penetration testing of two of my servers took place at   :   utc i found an error on the site     bad gateway restarted nginx   nothing changed restarted mysql   nothing changed restarted php   the site worked. i didn t pay much attention to it because for   years of swimming in money i became very lazy and continued to ride on a yacht with titsy girls. at   :   i found that the site gives a new error     not found nginx tried to enter the server through ssh and could not the password did not fit as it turned out later all the information on the disks was erased. due to my personal negligence and irresponsibility i relaxed and did not update php in time the servers had php  . .  version installed which was successfully penetration tested most likely by this cve url as a result of which access was gained to the two main servers where this version of php was installed. i realize that it may not have been this cve but something else like  day for php but i can t be     sure because the version installed on my servers was already known to have a known vulnerability so this is most likely how the victims admin and chat panel servers and the blog server were accessed. the new servers are now running the latest version of php  . . . if anyone recognizes a cve for this version be the first to let me know and you will be rewarded. the problem doesn t just affect me. anyone who has used a vulnerable version of php keep in mind that your server may have been compromised i m sure many competitors may have been hacked in the same way but they didn t even realize how it happened. i m sure the forums i know are also hacked in the same way via php there are good reasons to be sure not only because of my hack but also because of information from whistleblowers. i noticed the php problem by accident and i m the only one with a decentralized infrastructure with different servers so i was able to quickly figure out how the attack happened if i didn t have backup servers that didn t have php on them i probably wouldn t have figured out how the hack happened. the fbi decided to hack now for one reason only because they didn t want to leak information from url the stolen documents contain a lot of interesting things and donald trump s court cases that could affect the upcoming us election. personally i will vote for trump because the situation on the border with mexico is some kind of nightmare biden should retire he is a puppet. if it wasn t for the fbi attack the documents would have been released the same day because the negotiations stalled right after the partner posted the press release to the blog the fbi really didn t like the public finding out the true reasons for the failure of all the systems of this city. had it not been for the election situation the fbi would have continued to sit on my server waiting for any leads to arrest me and my associates but all you need to do to not get caught is just quality cryptocurrency laundering. the fbi can sit on your resources and also collect information useful for the fbi but do not show the whole world that you are hacked because you do not cause any critical damage you bring only benefit. what conclusions can be drawn from this situation very simple that i need to attack the .gov sector more often and more it is after such attacks that the fbi will be forced to show me weaknesses and vulnerabilities and make me stronger. by attacking the .gov sector you can know exactly if the fbi has the ability to attack us or not. even if you updated your php version after reading this information it will not be enough because you have to change the hoster server all possible passwords user passwords in the database audit the source code and migrate everything there is no guarantee that you have not been hardened on the server. there is no guarantee that the fbi does not have  day for your servers about which they have already learned enough information to re hack so only a complete change of everything that can only be replaced will help. all other servers with backup blogs that did not have php installed are unaffected and will continue to give out data stolen from the attacked companies. as a result of hacking the servers the fbi obtained a database web panel sources locker stubs that are not source as they claim and a small portion of unprotected decryptors they claim      decryptors although there were almost       decryptors on the server most of which were protected and cannot be used by the fbi. thanks to the database they found out the generated nicknames of the partners which have nothing to do with their real nicknames on forums and even nicknames in messengers not deleted chats with the attacked companies and accordingly wallets for money which will be investigated and searched for all those who do not launder crypto and possibly arrest people involved in laundering and accuse them of being my partners although they are not. all of this information has no value because it is all passed to the fbi and without hacking the panel after every transaction by insurance agents or negotiators. the only thing that is of value and potential threat is the source code of the panel because of it is probably possible future hacks if you let everyone into the panel but now the panel will be divided into many servers for verified partners and for random people up to   copy of the panel for   partner on a separate server before there was one panel for everyone. due to the separation of the panel and greater decentralization the absence of trial decrypts in automatic mode maximum protection of decryptors for each company the chance of hacking will be significantly reduced. leak of the panel source code was also happening at competitors it didn t stop them from continuing their work it won t stop me either. the fbi says they received about      decryptors a nice figure but it doesn t look like the truth yes they received some unprotected decryptors those builds of the locker that were made without the maximum decryptor protection checkbox could only be received by the fbi in the last    days it s not known on what day the fbi got access to the server but we know exactly the date of cve disclosure and the date when php generated an error before feb   th the attacked companies were regularly paying even for unprotected decryptors so there is a chance the fbi were only on the server for   day it would be nice if the fbi released all the decryptors to the public then you could trust them that they really own the decryptors not bluffing and praising their superiority not the superiority of   smart pentester with a public cve. note that the vast majority of unprotected decryptors are from partners who encrypt brute force dedicas and spam single computers taking      ransoms i.e. even if the fbi has      decryptors they are of little use the main thing is that they didn t get all the decryptors for the entire   years of operation which number is about      . it turns out that the fbi were only able to get hold of  .  of the total number of decryptors yes it s bad but it s not fatal.     from this significant moment when the fbi cheered me up i will stop being lazy and make it so that absolutely every build loker will be with maximum protection now there will be no automatic trial decrypt all trial decrypts and the issuance of decryptors will be made only in manual mode. thus in the possible next attack the fbi will not be able to get a single decryptor for free. probably everyone has already noticed how beautifully the fbi has changed the design of the blog no one has ever been given such honors usually everyone just put the usual plug with the praise of all the special services of the world. although in fact only one person from all over the planet deserves praise the one who pentest my site and picked up the right public cve i wonder how much he was paid how much was his bonus if less than a million dollars then come work for me you ll probably make more with me. or just come talk to me at tox     b  a c   d fb   d      f d da cb  cebea      ae f     a  e d   c c ae b  remember that i always have an active bug bounty program and i pay money for bugs found. fbi doesn t appreciate your talents but i do and am willing to pay generously. i wonder why the alpha revil hive blogs were not designed so nicely why weren t their deanons published even though the fbi knows their identities strange isn t it because with such stupid methods fbi is trying to intimidate me and make me stop working. the fbi designer should work for me you have good taste i especially liked the new preloader in the new update i should do something similar usa uk and europe revolve around my logo brilliant idea right there made me feel very good thanks. a couple of my partners were arrested to be honest i doubt that very much they are probably just people who are laundering cryptocurrencies maybe they were working for some mixers and exchangers with drops that s why they were arrested and considered my partners it would be interesting to see the video of the arrest where at their homes lamborghinis and laptops with evidence of their involvement in our activities but i somehow think we will not see it because the fbi arrested random people to get a certificate of merit from the management say look there are arrests we are not getting money for nothing we are honestly working off taxes and imprisoning random people when real pentesters quietly continue their work. basssterlord is not caught i know basssterlord s real name and it s different than the poor guy the fbi caught. i don t know any military journalist from sevastopol colonel cassad and i never donated to anyone it would be nice if the fbi showed the transaction so i could check on the blockchain where they drew such conclusions from and why they claim it was me who did it i never do any transaction without a bitcoin mixer. if i may have used the same cryptocurrency exchange service that someone from evil corp used it absolutely does not mean i have anything to do with evil corp again where are the transactions how do i know who is using which exchanger i use different exchangers and i don t concentrate all my money on one cryptocurrency exchanger. let s blame the hundreds of other people who use publicly available exchanges on evil corp. i really dislike that all such throw ins are made without publishing transactions and wallets thus it is impossible to verify what is true. you can accuse me of anything without proving anything and there is no way i can refute it because there are no transactions and bitcoin wallets. the fbi states that my income is over     million dollars this is true i am very happy that i deleted chats with very large payouts now i will delete more often and small payouts too. these numbers show that i am on the right track that even if i make mistakes it doesn t stop me and i correct my mistakes and keep making money. this shows that no hack from the fbi can stop a business from thriving because what doesn t kill me makes me stronger. all fbi actions are aimed at destroying the reputation of my affiliate program my demoralization they want me to leave and quit my job they want to scare me because they can not find and eliminate me i can not be stopped you can not even hope as long as i am alive i will continue to do pentest with postpaid. i am very pleased that the fbi has cheered me up energized me and made me get away from entertainment and spending money it is very hard to sit at the computer with hundreds of millions of dollars the only thing that motivates me to work is strong competitors and the fbi there is a sporting interest and desire to compete. with competitors who will make more money and attack more companies and with the fbi whether they can catch me or not and i m sure they can t looking at the way they work. the fbi promised to publish my deanon but they didn t fulfill their promise these people dare to lie about me supposedly not deleting stolen information of companies after paying the ransom clowning around. it turns out that the fbi officially recognized themselves as liars and they lie very often as my familiar lawyers arkady buch dmitry naskavets and victor smilyanets stated now i believe them     . they made a foolish attempt to discredit me by claiming that i work for the fbi a man who encrypts us companies every day and makes hundreds of millions of dollars does it with the approval of the fbi is that how it works very clever. you re thinking why would i work for hundreds of millions of dollars and i will answer that i am just bored i love my work it brings me joy from life money and luxury do not bring such joy as my work that s why i am ready to risk my life for the sake of my work that s how bright rich and dangerous life should be in my opinion. when i write the word fbi i mean not only fbi but also all their assistants who know how to arrest servers of partners which act as the first lining after stealing data from the attacked company and do not represent any value: south west regional organized crime unit in the u.k. metropolitan police service in the u.k. europol gendarmerie c n in france the state criminal police office l k a and federal criminal police office in germany fedpol and zurich cantonal police in switzerland the national police agency in japan the australian federal police in australia the swedish police authority in sweden the national bureau of investigation in finland the royal canadian mounted police in canada and the national police in the netherlands. so please don t take offense i haven t forgotten about you you were also very helpful in this operation. but let me remind you that personally i think the only person who deserves an award and an honorable mention is the person who found a suitable public php cve for my servers i m assuming it s someone from prodaft. a list of backup blog domains that the fbi couldn t reach because they don t have php installed on these servers. these servers host not only the companies that you can see on the main domain but also many companies that have been handed over for manual download i.e. links that are secret and published if the company refuses to pay the ransom for example: url url these and many other companies have been saved they will be published later in a new blog. backup blog mirrors any domain can be substituted for the secret links in case any domain is overloaded from people wanting to download the stolen data: url url url url url url url url url url url url url url new domains of the main blog url url url url url url url even after the fbi hack the stolen data will be published on the blog there is no chance of destroying the stolen data without payment. and after introducing maximum protection on every build of locker there will be no chance of free decryption even for  .  of attacked companies. new affiliates can work in my affiliate program if they have a reputation on the forums can prove that they are pentesters with post payment or by making a deposit of   bitcoins the deposit increase is due to proof and beautiful advertising from the fbi which is that my affiliates and i earn together hundreds of millions of dollars and that no fbi with their assistants can scare me and stop me the stability of the service is guaranteed by years of continuous work. write tox     b  a c   d fb   d      f d da cb  cebea      ae f     a  e d   c c ae b

have been in this position with my current company for a few years now but i feel like i am struggling to keep up with others on my team. we have another architect who is light years ahead of me particularly in the cloud space . while this person is the only direct comparison i have in my org it used to be easier to let this gap slide because this other person has a general reputation as a beast however we have since hired on some engineers who are also ahead of me in the cloud space and it is getting more difficult to justify my continued position to myself. i understand that what is most important is that my boss is satisfied with my work and i am not exactly slacking but now i am in a position where i lack both the knowledge and output level of my fellow architect and i also have more qualified engineers coming up behind me. i landed this position at an earlier time in our team maturity but i do not feel that i have really advanced since then which makes me feel more and more like a legacy. i know the easy answer here: i should just take the time to study more and skill up. the problem is i mostly lost interest in the it field years ago and not just in an ambivalent way    i mean i have grown to actively dislike this industry more and more. big tech is working hard to undermine our societal cohesion in the name of profits the cloud is creating serfs of us all and the field of cybersecurity itself is becoming more and more of a slap new tech over the top to cover up the real problems circle jerk. i refuse to attend conferences and whenever i do bother to tune into blackhat or secureworld or whatever every keynote address seems to include some variation of rates of compromise are increasing and we are doing worse at cybersecurity . i sit for training every year and enjoy learning new things but i actively avoid any certs because i have no interest in maintaining any more than i already do and i find myself increasingly hostile to a lot of tech. at this point i am really only still doing what i do because it pays well but it is a real slog for me . ultimately i am wondering what others in similar senior individual contributor positions have done when they encounter these challenges of feeling increasingly alienated from the tech. have you switched over to a management role moved into consulting or research jumped ship and left the industry altogether i make good money work life balance is great and my management seems satisfied with my output but i feel like i am letting my coworkers down and i no longer have much interest in what i do

early retirement... thanks', 'jobs being outsourced hello everyone i work for a pretty large mssp in soc in the u.s. i m closing in on almost   years here a couple months ago i was promoted to senior security analyst. i noticed a trend starting early last year the company starting doing layoffs at first for the tier   soc roles and helpdesk not all of them but a good amount then after a week or so we were introduced to new team members for the same roles that were laid off but they were based in india. then in sept of last year layoffs again this time tier   where i was at at the time. same thing a week later more teammates from india. finally once i was promoted a couple months ago to a senior i thought i would be safe.   weeks ago again layoffs announced this time some of our security engineers and software engineers you can see the cycle here surprise the following week those roles were replaced by people in india. now almost    of my team is based out of india in the soc i know with our helpdesk the figure is higher and with engineering its probably somewhere in the    . to be honest without disrespecting anyone ever since the arrival of the employees from india our quality of work has declined drastically i am continually having to intervene on tickets worked by them which is taking more time from myself having to work on high priority situations we are constantly having miscommunication issues and it has made work much more difficult then it needs to be. customers are filing more complaints then ever some of our application projects for engineering that were due to be released months ago have been pushed for a further timeframe of   to   months. we had some of our biggest clients telling us that they will have to think carefully if they will want to renew their contract with us. one of the main reasons i went into cybersecurity and spent so much time on education and certifications was because i was being told and led to believe this is a secure field for job risk. i understand a corporation s main goal is to generate profit. but i thought roles in this industry would be more inclined to not be outsourced due to the nature of security data that us companies would be inclined to not have that data accessible overseas. so i can see the writing on the wall either the company will start laying off the seniors and replacing us for cheaper labor or they will want us to stay here to oversee the environment. doesn t matter to me though because i don t want to work at this company anymore due to the reasons i stated above. i am continually seeing headlines of these tech layoffs but one of the main backings of these that isn t talked about enough in my opinion is outsourcing. so as i brush up my resume to start looking for another job which sucks to think about because i genuinely enjoyed working at this company previously. i think to myself and hopefully i can gain some insight from all of you what roles in the security field are less prone to outsourcing i am mostly experienced in blue team defense security and incident response should i start looking at red team cloud security application security or a specific industry in security etc. security is a vast field so i would love any input from you.', 'my security career   next level advice hey all i m currently an iam it security analyst making nearly   k. been in it nearly    years came from it support system administration and then it management. i work at a small company and have been there for a little over   years. this is my first full blown security position and i love it i wanted to get into security for a long time before this and have done security as a hobby for years. i don t consider myself a master or leet by any means but i do love this stuff like i seriously love this stuff. i guess i know more about the blue side than the red side though the red side is where i want to be but my career is not taking that direction and i feel like if i try i will lose a big chunk of salary for starting over. thoughts i love where i work. i have a small team and my managers are the best i ve ever had. i ve been working in it for nearly    years so i ve been around enough to know they re truly amazing. i have no complaints about my job. i get to have my hands in nearly everything and the leaders teach me extremely valuable stuff not just about security but about high level office politics things like that. my gripe is my senior. he doesn t deserve to be a senior. he s not a technical person and he s not experienced enough to be there. his work ethic is horrible and he s rarely even online. when he is he s often out and about not at home at his station. on nearly every project and i unfortunately mean on nearly every project i have to step in and take over because he s not capable of finding the proper solution for our goal or incapable of troubleshooting something basic like even looking at okta system logs to see what went wrong... i can t take it anymore. the silver lining is that my resum  is what it is thanks to his lack of ability. i started putting myself out there for engineering level positions about a month ago on linkedin and the level of interest in me has been nice to see. i ve been talking to recruiters and have gotten two interviews and i have another call with a new recruiter tomorrow for yet another opportunity. the first one didn t work out but i m glad about it. the hiring manager interviewed me for    minutes kept asking me questions on how i do things and i was knocking them out but in the end his excuse to the recruiter was that he was worried the role would be boring for me and that i d leave after finding something more interesting. but i didn t like the guy or the company s situation so i am glad that didn t work out. i m not in a rush to leave anyway and am super happy where i am so wherever i go will have to be perfect for me to leave what i have now. i have another round   interview later this week for a different opportunity and this one is more related to iam and managing external identities with auth  which i haven t really done though we have auth  where i am now it s just not fully integrated into our portals yet. i m concerned about this interview because i think it ll mostly be about that but i know i can do the job i just need to spend some time with auth  to get to know it like i do okta but i learned okta pretty quickly and easily. i don t know why i m even typing this. i m just nervous maybe because when i land my next job my family s lives will change. but at the same time i m nervous because i don t have the confidence i usually have in interviews because i only have   years of directly related experience in security but the thing is that i have such a technical mindset and learn so quick that i know i can do the job successfully but of course on the hiring side it s a bit different hearing that lol. i don t know... i know eventually i ll land one of these jobs. i have to right wish me luck. thanks everyone sorry for the long post. i talk a lot lol']",workload and time pressure

of my way forward i led a cyber operations team for   years. i did client management evaluating cyber training courses to help develop the training pipeline for enlisted cyber specialists and advising higher command on mission planning. unfortunately i did not have time to obtain a major certificate such as cissp. my next job was a non cyber role on a ship. the closest roles that would be applicable to cyber security was my responsibility of personnel and physical information security administration . with recent developments in the military if i stay in my future job would be non cyber for another   years. so i put in my resignation from active duty and a request to go to the reserves. that does leave me a little less than a year before my final day in the military to prepare for the switch to civilian life. and that remaining time will still be incredibly busy for me due to the ship s deployment schedule. two options i can think of right now:   pursue a master s in cyber or it related field. one of my parents is a long time employee at an university that offers a    tuition discount for their children. combined with the gi tuition assistance that makes the degree essentially free. this does require me to study for gre or gmat.   take an extended time off to obtain cyber certificates and then apply for jobs. any recommendations', 'employer offers to pay for all

software training upgrades. i don t have any major cyber certificates due to my busy workload. my non cyber work experiences are physical information security manager and nuclear engineering . before i joined the military my background was manufacturing automation engineering where i wired and programmed industrial control systems and everything that was related to those. i have the option of attending naval postgraduate school to obtain a masters degree in cyber operations. there is no cost for me and i would still be paid my full salary while in school for   years. the only condition is that i would owe another   years to the military which would be one more cyber tour . or i could just do one   year cyber tour without the master s degree before getting out. the third option is to

cybersecurity training and assessments on navy commands. my long term goal is to become a fortune     cio and though i think that s an achievable goal i know that will take some time. additionally i will be separating next year because i believe it would be beneficial for my goal to get civilian experience after    years of service. my short term goal is make efficient use of my next few years to set me up correctly for my long term goal. this includes utilizing my gi bill to obtains a masters and applying to a job that lines up well with future goal. my choices are sans.edu:   being a naval officer i haven t been technical since college. while i understand the concepts i m no where near as good at programming and project management as i was    years ago. i m afraid my lack of expertise will be a deterrent for fortune     companies.   the navy and dod network is very different than civilian networks. i pray this isn t too big of a gap between civilian networks and deters employers

nuances of the new industry but i m very uneducated about this aspect. my redeeming features :   i have a lot of leadership experience and regularly act as an intermediary between technical and

for a company that would like me to have a higher degree i have the gi bill in my back pocket which is an incentive to higher me. regarding my connudrum of which program i should look into i m worried

market solutions as security practitioners we are faced with constant new products and internal initiatives to buy implement upgrade or replace systems. for many teams this results in ad hoc research and may not have any augmentation from a program management organization depending on the size of the business. for this quick tutorial i m hoping to provide a framework for evaluating the market and a spreadsheet you can reference to fill out your requirements and compare vendor solutions. quick note: there are multiple phases for projects and i m going to skip the boring pmp explainer here . ideally the final ranking here is going to come from your project sponsors stakeholders though security engineering definitely plays a role in expressing their opinions around what the business needs. it s important that requirements are based on and focused on business functionality and not marketing word salad. avoiding vendor specific terminology and brand names in your requirements ensures that you don t put yourself in the position of grading products differently because they use a different naming scheme.     part two: scoring scoring is a complex topic mostly because many people have their favorite form of scoring. in the model i m sharing we re using two main concepts for the scores:  . weighting: the ability to set certain requirements as more or less important than others.  . quantified expectation analysis: the ability to set how well expectations were met. before you get into reviewing specific vendors take the time to review your weighting with the engineering team and other stake holders involved with the project. agreeing up front on which functions capabilities are most important and least important prevents marketing candy from distracting you down the line when you interview vendors. after the weighting is complete start doing analysis on the different tools in the market. i find that getting free gartner reports g  information and other community based feedback on solution provides insights that you can use to quickly weed out any under performing solutions. this information on its own cannot pick a solution for you but it can definitely help you limit your proof of concepts to   or   in a bake off later on. as you complete your market analysis you can document any notes and start to use the quantified expectation analysis in the spreadsheet. a score of   means that the capability meets the stake holder expectations. a score of   means the capability is straight up missing. a score of   indicates that the capability exceeds expectations and is market leading. as you fill out your scores the product score will update including the weighted information and provide a cumulative score you can review. the cumulative score of   indicates that a product meets requirement expectations in general. there may be some misses but those are offset with some unexpected goodies that level out the overall experience. a cumulative score of   would indicate that the product exceeded expectations across the board. so which is better it depends. a solution at just a   meets your expectations. this by definition this is what we want. so now we can consider other options like budget quality of life etc. and compare it to the solutions that exceed expectations. with the data in hand we can make the best decision for the business at the

the ability of threat actors to rewrite existing malware. the researchers used models to rewrite known malware samples iteratively using techniques like variable renaming string splitting junk code insertion removal of unnecessary whitespaces and a complete reimplementation of the code. the idea is that these small changes could degrade the overall effectiveness of malware classification systems while also making the code look more naturally written when reviewed by a human. to combat this palo alto generated tens of thousands of variants to train its own detection algorithms better reporting it saw a    detection rate improvement. url techcrunch lists the most badly handled data breaches of      techcrunch is out with its annual summary of breaches whose behavior or response could at least be seen as a learning opportunity for others. this year s list includes   andme who blamed their customers for not sufficiently securing their accounts change healthcare who took months to confirm hackers stole most of america s health data by breaching a basic user account with a lack of multi factor authentication. also on the list snowflake whose breach was a result of a s lack of mandated use of multi factor security and the city of columbus ohio sued a security researcher for truthfully reporting on a ransomware attack. details on these stories and four more one of which is of course salt typhoon are available through the link in the show notes to this episode. url general dynamics says employees targeted in phishing attack the aerospace and defense company says threat actors compromised dozens of employee benefits accounts after a successful phishing campaign targeting its personnel. the activity was discovered on october    and took the form of a fraudulent advertising campaign that directed general dynamics employees to a phishing site where they were deceived into entering their usernames and passwords. a total of    people were affected and in addition to accessing pii and government id numbers in some cases the attackers changed bank account information. url japan airlines systems are back to normal after cyberattack the airline announced yesterday thursday that its systems have returned to normal following a cyberattack delayed some international and domestic flights. the attack occurred at  :   a.m. local time and shut down a router that was causing malfunctions and which suspended ticket sales for flights departing on thursday. representatives said no customer data was leaked and no damage was registered. this event follows on the heels of a brief outage that affected flights for american airlines on tuesday evening christmas eve. this particular outage was issued at the airline s request after it experienced trouble with its flight operating system or fos. the airline blamed technology from one of its vendors. url and url ruijie networks cloud platform flaws could expose devices to remote attacks researchers at claroty discovered the flaws that they say affect both the ruijie platform as well as reyee os network devices. if exploited they could allow a malicious attacker to execute code on any cloud enabled device giving them the ability to control tens of thousands of devices. of the    vulnerabilities discovered by claroty three are rated critical in severity with cvss scores of  .   .  and  . . their

last october s data breach that affected nearly seven million people and which has spawned a class action lawsuit on behalf of certain members of specific genetic heritage groups the company now states that its members are actually to blame. according to the guardian   andme sent a letter to the customers who were taking legal action stating the information that was potentially accessed cannot be used for any harm and then placed blame on users themselves who negligently recycled and failed to update their passwords. experts such as barbara prainsack a professor of comparative policy at the university of vienna and a   andme customer described the company as having had a long time to establish data breach protocols continuing this is almost a textbook case of how things should not

months ago about a a modern red teaming roadmap. a number of people have messaged me about sharing this information and i cant respond to you all alas i will post it here for anyone interested. disclaimer: i don t have all the answers and in the grand scheme of things i m not really that good. what is contained below is my opinion which has been formed from red teaming over the last decade or so and having been lucky enough to see a number of top teams conduct some big tests and how things have changed over time. a couple of important principles:   evasion is a lot harder defences are layered and in many cases defences   detections are not immediately visible. act accordingly. you will need to write your own tooling. get competent at native programming   reverse engineering and research the internals of your target operating systems.   the detection perimeter now extends to all of your internet infrastructure. you must have covert attack infrastructure which is resilient to analysis by those with access to core internet backbone net flow data. i won t name the company here but this is a commercially available service and will get you caught.   as a team   member of a team you will need to invest much more heavily in research and development of your tooling. in the last   years i have not witnessed a successful engagement that used cobalt strike including heavily customised versions of it. it will get you caught.   the threat intel is often very poor. commercial entities are incentivised to attribute detected attacks to insert authoritarian state here because it makes them seem a lot more competent than they actually are. take it with a pinch of salt. even better learn about conducting your own operations to gather the relevant intelligence you need for you organisation. if you re interested i can cover some of this stuff in another post.   aspire to be a threat actor first then a red teamer second. a real apt has operational goals has an economic cost to conducting operations and cant ask to be legged up when they do something stupid. you re not in a race to get to the operational goal. take your time take acceptable risks. understand the impact you are having on the target. think sniper in a ghille suit stalking your target.   stop trying to emulate threat actors. it s a load of rubbish invented by someone trying to sell gullible people something they don t need. if anyone presents themselves as an authority on insert nation state group   apt group here ask them their background. if   it doesn t include a significant proportion of time in their countries bonne fide intelligence service   they have worked directly with that group ignore everything they have to say. the operational cyber world is very clandestine and apt groups are probably actually lots of different entities that have been misattributed. people come and go have different ways of doing things leadership changes. just because fire eye says something is apt   and that s how they work does not mean   it is actually them   they will ever operate like that again. we are selling ourselves short if we think the adversaries we are up against are that naive. they aren t. these places are organised to ensure the left hand doesn t know what the right hand is doing. someone next door doesn t know what s happening one room over. someone at fire eye probably doesn t know either. remember that and read the threat intel see things you think are interesting but take with a pinch of salt.   get your head into the research and keep your finger on the pulse. actors will weaponised high quality public research and use in their operations. you should too.   embrace automation. do you need   weeks standing up your attack infrastructure for every job how many times do you do it a year how long would it take to automate   work as a team. no one is infallible. we all make mistakes. embrace a learning mentality individually and as a team. do after action reviews. what could you have done better. leave your egos at the door.    if you are on an internal red team then as a team you need to streamline your ability to test. the game we play is a matter of small details. military operations are about having the right people in the right place at the right time with the right equipment to exploit a vulnerability in the disposition of an enemy force. cyber isn t much different. trust me a competent attacker that has your organisation in their crosshairs is probably doing continuous reconnaissance on your internet facing presence and likely has alerting configured should something relevant be discovered. if it takes you   months to get permission to test the smallest thing then that s probably too late. continuous rt or gtfo. building a strong foundation of relevant skills i will break these down into operator skills and capability development skills. capdev is the intersectionality between pure reverse engineering   research and software engineering. examples include categorising an edr software to understand how it works and then building a capability to defeat that technology. operator skills:   manual testing skills yes it s not bleeding edge but it forms a good foundation to build on.   active directory   you are probably going to find yourself in active directory environments. learn about how they work. how to attack and defend them crto crto  crt.   cloud hybrid environments: a lot of places are using hybrid on premises and cloud based architectures. learn about how you can abuse the access from one to the other and visa versa. cartp carte are good. cyberwarfare labs has some courses as does s  security . there s probably more. more specialist red team operator courses:   heard good things about rogue labs.   spectreops course is good. highly recommend.   blackhills etc etc.   in the future i might have a course you can attend. research skills:   you probably need to learn about how edrs work. matt hand has a great book. james foreshaw has just released a book about windows security internals. ask santa nicely for both.   learn some reverse engineering. by first learning how to forward engineering in assembly. i cannot begin to describe how often i m looking at assembly code. i know it sounds obvious but sometimes you just gotta look. and if you can look at how it s actually implemented vs how they think it s implemented well you might get lucky.   learn some modern exploit development. if you find a binary exploit like in oscp   osce in a modern environment it s probably a honey pot or you are in the wrong target. people who can afford red teaming tend to have good enough security that they don t leave free float ftp server on the perimeter. modern exploit development

why is everyone promoting passkeys i seem to be misunderstanding the security model of passkeys. i try to login to some financial institution and they recommend passkeys . great no need to pull up my phone and get my authenticator totp app to give me a code. except... well the passkey is now stored at the same place where the password is. on the machine that contains the password manager. meaning: if the passkey is stored in your password manager or is stored on your machine in some place where it s extractable with malware this basically means that your  fa is nullified. a hacker who gains access to your password manager can basically break into all these websites that support passkeys. so it seems to me that using passkeys without a hardware device is just a bad bad idea. but... no one is talking about this including the websites promoting passkeys. what am i missing', 'why passkeys are dangerous passkeys are universally advertised as the future and replacement for passwords. but is that the case everyone says that they are now secure than passwords but i don t believe this. on surface level it looks true. passkeys use private and public keys so private keys should be kept private you can t normally expose it so you should be kept secret. but it s not that simple. some platforms have a lock in like apple where if you create a passkey stored on apple you can t change it so you are forced to either change the passkey or to use your apple device. then data breaches. they claim that passkeys are not susceptable to them but when you think about it   what does icloud keystore does it stores your passkeys. yeah they are encrypted but so what they are not hashed just encrypted so you could probably hack it. it s quite risky. but the worst would be zero day exploits. if you find an exploit which can get private keys from devices it s over   all of your passkeys on every account are compromised with every user it s done. some hacker in the future could find just one vulnerability and get access to every account on earth which is terrible. that is because passkeys ignore  fa. then you can do the same with physical theft. if your device is stolen same story   all your accounts protected by passkeys are compromised. this is not the case with passwords  fa because if they steal your device they don t know the password. and breaking into your device is usually pretty easy. so passkeys are better than passwords without  fa and they may be better than easy passwords with  fa. but with a strong password with  fa it would be weaker. and you don t need to remember the passwords   just use a password manager and it would generate the best passwords possible. another danger of passkeys is a fa ade of security. it provides a feeling that you are protected with the latest technology and so don t have to worry about security. but that is very dangerous approach to security. in fact you should think and act in such a way as if security was a loaded gun. this makes passkeys just another vector of attack and such vector that could target much more accounts at once with a vulnerability found. they provide a feeling of security to most people which makes them disregard security. also passkeys are currently created alongside passwords so they just create a security weaknesses without removing weaknesses from passwords. what are your thoughts on this am i wrong', 'passkeys are a lie greetings secure people of reddit : i hope i picked the right flair. in short i dont get passkeys. i mean i think i understand the encryption and the public private key sharing between servers and devices but i dont really see how they make us more secure. im not adopting any passkeys for this reason whereas it seems the entire industry and their grandmas have jumped on the passkey hype train and i truly believe i must be missing the point. id be grateful if you could join me on my path to enlightenment and help me understand what im missing. now ive been on reddit before   please lets be civil and factual. im genuinely trying to learn and understand this topic. im always happy to admit where im wrong and try be smarter next time.  . to start off whenever i read up on the superiority of passkeys i see people explain how weak reused passwords with no mfa are bad security. and so from the get go the proof of passkey superiority depends on people being terrible at passwords. what if some people arent terrible at passwords password managers have been a thing for decades at this point and theres a lot of people aliasing their logins using long unique passwords peppering them securing it with totp or additional hardware keys and so on. are passkeys really that much better  . i understand that a passkey is meant to be stored on a device. but lets face it in majority of cases it wont. people will prevent access loss by adding passkeys to some sort of a passkey vault   either a password manager or an account. would a passkey stored in a vault be less secure than a passkey stored on a device after all in this case we dont leverage mfa and we cant pepper a passkey in the vault. the moment our vault is accessed all passkeys are there immediately ready to go.  . one of password pepper mfa benefits to me is that it is a bit cumbersome by design. i think its way harder to get sb to give you their    character password followed up with a totp code at a knifepoint in a mugging scenario. it is way easier when you can just flash someones face fingerprint over a screen in a matter of seconds. will we see an increase in physical security events because of it  . in terms of remote security events another common argument is phishing. but phishing resistance is not exclusive to passkeys password managers will detect a fake site and just not autofill some will even flash a warning. am i oblivious to how easy it is to trick a password manager to recognize a fake site  . the argumentation usually reaches a point where passkey promoters will cave in and admit you will never really go passwordless and will still need to have passwords   so that you can perform the initial login and generate passkeys. doesnt this kill the go passwordless point altogether  . frankly this sounds to me even worse if you truly can go passwordless and need only approve one device with another device. again majority of people will sync all passkeys to their google or apple account. seems to me that all it takes to own a person then is to figure out their google login and get them to tap their screen at the right moment. now that youve joined their keychain you can punch them throw out their device and you should have a good couple of hours to deactivate passkeys on their other devices or just wreak havoc on their digital life. again this just doesnt sound promising for the physical security point.  . and yes i know biometric local security is cool and convenient. but it is a thing we can set up on most mfa apps and for years now. but with passkeys we dont need to input a username we dont need to input a password and we dont need to copy the totp. convenient but doesnt sound helpful for security.  . the few people who are criticizing passkeys often mention fabricating passkeys. is there a way passkeys can be spoofed seems unlikely to me but we now know session hijacking is a thing so are passkeys truly resistant to this form of attack just a few things that came to mind. and im ignoring the entire point about getting locked up in an ecosystem and the privacy aspect of it   thats probably a topic for a different subreddit thank you']",poor leadership and lack of support
