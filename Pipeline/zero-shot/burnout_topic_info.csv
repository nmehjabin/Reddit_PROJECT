I believe this is framed incorrectly. I don\'t think we need to constantly learn security. I think we need to constantly learn the tech we plan to apply core security concepts to.\n\nThis field simply requires a drive to continue learning and enough self directed learning skills to make digesting the influx of new tech easy. The core concepts of security stay exactly the same. The technology you apply them to changes by the minute. I think a lot of people conflate the passion for learning with the passion for security itself, admittedly I even make this same mistake regularly when mentoring, I say security instead of learning. Passion for both is absolutely great if that\'s your thing, but the passion for learning tech or what ever you want to apply security to should be enough.\n\nThere\'s also people with differing work experiences and differing intelligence levels. If your employer gives you time for continued learning and experimentation on the clock (which it absolutely should, if not, find another employer) - you don\'t have to appear as passionate about learning new tech outside of your working hours. If your employer is short sighted and doesn\'t provide adequate time/space/money for education, you are going to need to invest your own time outside of work in the pursuit of learning new tech and work towards finding a new employer. Even if your employer provides time for you to learn, but you are not someone that is capable of really handling self directed learning, you are going to need to appear passionate about tech outside of your job.\n\nAre there employers where you can sit on arse and do almost no personal development without having to worry about it after hours? Yes, there absolutely are. These are not typically highly paid. You are also stuck should you have a desire to move or if the company shuts down. If you are forced into finding a new job after some time employed at a place that doesn\'t change, your skills and knowledge on current tech would have become so irrelevant that you are now out of a job and job searching while having to try to make your resume and interview skills relevant again - you\'ve effectively become a new hire or fresh grad again.\n\nThere\'s another caveat to this. A lot of recent education and certification programs that try to get people into the industry quickly teach ""security"" (compliance) instead of the foundations that security can be applied to nearly anything. Most people who think security, not tech in general, are a constant slog are probably not well prepared to do security. People often misidentify security as compliance, checklists, antivirus, top 10s, and patching. If you\'ve memorized ""security"" and you require someone else to provide you a checklist or some compliance framework to get things done, it probably really does appear like security is a grind game where your job is to memorize the latest framework and checklist. I\'m literally cringing thinking about this closed view of what security is - and it doesn\'t even work to improve legitimate and functional security.\n\nYou can effectively abstract all of security to the CIA triangle. The problem is most people that don\'t seem to understand this aren\'t technical enough to make that abstraction. They don\'t want to be technical. For them, the constant drudgery of learning the latest security topic (not tech in general) really probably is miserable and I\'d agree with them.\n\nSo what we do in security as competent security engineers and security professionals is apply basic concepts to tech we we keep up to date on. You can\'t secure it effectively if you don\'t know how it works.\n\nWhat are the foundations that make you effective in security if they aren\'t security? OS admin, Net admin, and coding skills are what makes you competent to take on everything in security. Throw in some cloud and AI if you want to spice it up, but these are mostly abstractions on top of OS/Net/Code. If you\'ve got OS admin, Net admin, and coding skills, there\'s almost nothing that is overly complicated and you can\'t figure out how to apply security to. The core concept of security can be had in the CIA Triangle.', ""What's the next step for me?\nHi All,\n\nI'm currently working as a Cyber Security analyst, doing an apprenticeship and it's been around 17 months or so and will finish soon. I had no prior IT experience or degree, but I was quite interested in cyber security and so took a leap and applied for the role and eventually got accepted. I'm enjoying the training so far from the apprenticeship though it seems a lot more information security and less technical but I'd say I have the foundational knowledge of networking and security now.\n\nHowever, when it comes to my actual workplace, I'm kinda worried. We're a small company. The sec team is just me and my manager. We use Darktrace for our network and identity monitoring, Tenable for vulnerabilities, 365 Defender which we don't really utilise and Azure which hosts our infra. My day to day is usually going through the alerts from Darktrace and checking whether the activities are actually something to raise to my manager (e.g. someone trying to access a blocked website or downloading a suspicious file) or if it's a normal activity that was just picked up as an alert, check spam/phishing emails and block them. I also let our Infra team know of any outstanding patches to be applied from Tenable. Other than that, I pretty much just document the stuff I do. Also, I've been trying to understand Defender better and going through some of the recommendations from the portal to implement. We don't use a framework or do any kind of risk management, or even threat hunting. And I believe my manager is quite new to cyber security but has prior IT experience and the role was given to them. So when it comes to learning from them, it's quite limited. I feel like I'm not learning as much as I should be in the workplace overall, especially the technical knowledge and I thought I would be a lot more hands on (security engineer?). Because of this, I've been doing some self learning with TryHackMe in my free time which has been helping a lot and find it fun too. I've recently stopped though to focus on finishing the apprenticeship\n\nMy question is, does what I'm doing align with the typical responsibilities of a junior cybersecurity analyst role? What should I be doing/learning more? What would you suggest my next move to be? Would appreciate any advice! \n\nThanks"", 'Am I going crazy, just burnt out, or just completely wrong?\nThis will likely be long and sorry😅\n\nSome back story - I\'ve been working as a SOC analyst for about close to \\~7 years now. I worked my way up from Tier 1 to Tier 3 with a vast range of experience from your basic triage, to standing up and fine-tuning, various EDR and SIEM solutions, to supporting/investigating IR/DR engagements. \n\nAbout 2 years ago, I left the MSSP scene - idk call it retiring from the front lines I guess - I decided to clam down and go from focusing on multiple clients to just one.  I took a role supporting a local medium sized company and everything was going well. Fast-fwd about 6 months the company was bought out by a rapidly growing ""tech company"". keep in mind the company is leaps a head in all of the other aspects just severely lacking in IT dept.\n\nI\'m sure you all know how these kinds of acquisitions go and the technical nightmare that comes with them.\n\n  \nOk enough of me, I work at a company that has grown exponentially way too fast and senior IT leadership doesn\'t want to fix or address any underlying issues that i am seeing a problem in regards to our cybersecurity posture. I\'m going to try and articulate my issues - Maybe I\'m just young and dumb I don\'t know anymore 😅maybe im just burnt out and tired\n\n- I am a security team of 2 ""trying"" to support a company of over 5000 employees all over India/CAN/US\n\n* yes, you heard that right, all of cyber security relaying on the backs of 2 people who dont even have the correct roles to properly and thoroughly investigate any alerts of interest or suspicion. \n* Ever since our merge, - since day one I have been constantly complaining on my lack of access I have to do the the daily activities that I see fit for this role. We are MS shop, M365, E3/ E5(been pushing for this)Intune, defender, sentinel, azure... you get the point. \n   * Me as a senior- I dont even have the security administrator role or GA noting - just security reader (tf and I suppose to do with this) ; when i asked my manger about why the security team doesnt even have the roles to do their job properly, their reply was - ""the infrastructure manager doesn\'t want the security team with more privileges than they need"" Am I just young and naive or is this the most absurd comment that they could have said ?? - no discussion about it or anything just straight up ""no because I said so"" \n\n-My manager and other senior IT leaders say that cybersecurity is its main priority and will support and provide whatever resources it needs. \n\n* Piggy backing off my lack of access is the never ending false promises and never ending security theatre.\n* For a year ive been practically begging for better visibility into our infra structure and endpoints\n   * In all my years of experience I have never witnessed a more unorganized IT stack in my life I have been trying to show this leadership team for years that we are understaffed and under supported and also given them recommendations to try and assist ; all of which was either laughed at or ignored. \n      * Ive been trying to push for an accurate list of devices and endpoints\n      * Pushing for centralized logging of all infrastructure and endpoints\n      * Accurate and up-to date user lists\n      * Wanting to stand up defender for endpoint, sentinel, intune etc. practically leverage all of the MS E5 Suite. \n      * Better SIEM threat detections. \n   * I am a senior analyst & for fuck sakes and I dont even know what assets I\'m trying to protect. Is this a me problem or a leadership problem? like I find myself trying and trying and trying to get answers that i can never seem to get for some odd reason. An IT foundation built on sand...\n\nEven with all of these issues I still show up to work everyday and try to do my job the best I can with what am given.\n\nHere is where it gets interesting. \n\nYesterday I was doing some proactive threat hunting and came across a very particular IOC with known ties to APT 27. Said IOC was a publicly reported as a known webshell dropper in multiple DFIR reports.\n\n* after seeing this and from my previous experience, I started to immediately dive into it head on. Given my limited access and resources available, escalated this internally to my manger and the Infra manager. Both seemed to be clueless and have no sense of urgency in this matter. it was like i was talking to a wall. I waited close to 2 hours to finally get some help on trying to track down the device only to for the infrastructure manager to tell me that because its ""blocked"" its not a threat - note we have only observed a highly known APT IOC at this point we had no idea of the whole picture, no device name, users, nada. i have senior IT manager telling me -  security professional that an observed APT activity should be ignored since its blocked???????? No matter how many times I tried explain to my managers that there is a unknown machine on our network that is constantly trying to phone home to its c2 infrastructure for further instructions. They just ignored my request to investigate.\n* Taking things into my own hands I tried to convince a few network folks to try and help me track down this unknown device in question. Long story short the initial questionable dns request that started this whole investigation was coming from our known FW Ip. I have no clue how our DNS is configured but from what we could see was a never ending DNS fwding loop. trying to track down where the original malicious DNS request was coming from was an absolutely nightmare.\n* we spent close to 4 hours trying to track down said device with the help of my friends on the network team, vastly going above and beyond compared to others in this case. \n* At the end of the day our managers basically told us to give up and isnt worth investigating anymore because its blocked. \n\nFast forward to today, during our weekly team meeting my manager practically starts off the meeting in a nice way by said that I practically ""cried wolf""  and that yesterdays incident was nothing to be worried about and that the infra team will take care of it. \n\n* Im still seeing this c2 traffic trying to phone home as im writing this...\n\nIs this not the biggest fuck you to my face or am i just being young dumb and clueless? to me I\'m just trying to the job i was hired to do but I\'m met with nothing but resistance and unwillingness to do things related to my job. \n\nI cried wolf to a known APT27 IOC that we still do not have any answers to. \n\nAm I overqualified? undervalued? or just dealing with clueless leadership?  Man I just want to be able to do my job.']"

I am 45 years old and have been a computer hobbyist since I was a kid. I have no formal training or past job experience in IT and have been out of the workforce for over ten years (taking care of my family). I never went to college for mostly financial reasons and never considered it until recently. I found out I was able to attend community college tuition-free through a program due to not having a degree. After looking through all the career path options available, I landed on cybersecurity. It seems the best fit for many reasons but what turned me on to it most was the job growth and median pay.  \r  \n\r  \nSo, I am now enrolled and just into my 3rd week of college, working on my associate degree with a major in cybersecurity. The community college I am going to has a specific program/career path for cybersecurity recognized by the NSA/Homeland Security and a dedicated simulation lab. I chose this college because they were the only one local that had those recognitions.  \r  \n\r  \nI have read posts debating certs vs degrees and I am willing to get both. From what I see it seems like an associate degree + certs would be the best option for me. I am not sure exactly what area I will fall into as I am hoping through learning, I will find what works best for me but as of right now, I feel management would be the best place for me. So, for now, that is what is in my sight.  As a student, I have access to a couple of Coursera Google certs that I will get.  Google IT support and the Google Project management for sure but I was not sure if the data analytics would be worth it. I plan to also get ISC2 and Sec+ but I am not sure what else other than that I should focus on.  \r  \n\r  \nI know this is going to be difficult, but I did think it would be easy to get a job right out of college. But now I see that I might have been a bit naive on my part and I am wondering if this was a good idea. I am prepared for a solid 2+ years of getting the knowledge and skills required to get into the field. But I would really like to spend that time in the most beneficial way possible as I am already so far behind. I know many things are stacked against me in this age, lack of degrees/certs, and official experience. Any advice from people doing this would be appreciated, thanks in advance.', 'Is a Bachelor’s Degree worth pursuing given my background?\nHey everyone! I\'m arriving at a bit of a crossroads in my career decisions. Put shortly - I want to specialize while reducing the customer-facing side of my job role. To cut to the chase - I\'m looking for some guidance from some of you industry veterans on whether or not it\'s worth it to pursue a Bachelor\'s Degree in Cybersecurity with my background or if it makes more sense to try diving right into some applications. \n\nWork experience-wise I have a little over 5 years of combined time in the IT industry: \n\n* I\'ve been working for VMware (now Broadcom. Yes, it\'s rough here.) as a Technical Support Engineer for \\~2 years and specialize in ESXi, VM, Certificate, Network, and vCenter management SME categories. \n* Before that I worked at an MSP for \\~2.5 years and learned more than I could have ever hoped to in such a short period of time. My skill-set developed with desktop support, active directory, network stack (multiple vendors), MDM, Azure, Microsoft 365, Exchange Online, Google Workspace, VOIP system, account, endpoint, and network security policy, and other types of administration experience. In addition to this I also was put into the role of a Project Manager for some clients and towards the end of my time with this small MSP became the primary client-facing ""on-site"" technician for just about every major client we had. \n* My break into the IT industry was a temp/internship PoS support desk role at a retail corporation that was cut short at 6 months because I was laid off when March 2020 happened. While this role didn\'t exactly encompass much on the technical side, it helped me get to my position at the MSP above. I was still a full-time student when I took this job.\n\nMy formal education and certifications aren\'t anything to write home about in the slightest, but I do have an Associate\'s Degree in Computer Networking and Cyber Security from a Community College (the program was basically just a CCNA bootcamp. The \'security\' side of it was practically non-existent). I also have/had a CompTia A+ (expired May of 2024) that I used strictly as leverage to get a raise at my MSP job as I was greener than grass at the time I was hired there and had not even completed schooling yet. It took me <1 mo to get both A+ tests prepped, booked, and passed. \n\n  \nWith all this in mind, here is the long form of the question - I have been working through [tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com) to see if the pentesting route is something I find interest in as I always had a desire to learn Linux, but never had the drive to do it. Learning how to hack into things gives me something \'cool\' to do with Linux and has started me down the path to learning more than I did with creating BASH scripts for package installations on Apple MDM platforms. I find this stuff very interesting/fun and have throughout the years found it fun educating not only end-users, but also management/C-Level personnel how quick and easy it is to make a few changes to ensure simple attack vectors can be mitigated (and subsequently save money/data from the potential fallout). Especially when talking to the management teams at my MSP clients you would see these people light up with joy when you do something as easy as MFA on emails because they understand it significantly reduces the chance of an account breach. Security has always been fascinating to me. Seeing how 9/10 times when a breach occurs it\'s due to negligence leads me to want to pursue this as a career path from the broader background I have.\n\nIs it even worth it to pursue a Bachelor\'s Degree given that I already have an Associates in Cybersecurity and 5+ years experience in the field? I know at the very least getting the Net+ and Sec+ for my resume are good first steps, but the monetary setback of a degree is daunting. Should I just jump into some job applications now, or am I too unqualified for some roles just yet? Specifically I am looking to first dip my toes in with a Security Analyst role. \n\nTo avoid this dragging on further I\'ll end it here, but any input is greatly appreciated :)', 'I’m tired of applying for jobs (rant)\nI’m so done. I’ve applied to 1000+ jobs in the last 10 months and I’ve only gotten rejections. At this point I’m just so tired and stressed and anxious and depressed. I lost my job last November and I have been looking for so long. Trying everything I can. Reaching out to people on linked. Applying for jobs everywhere, all over the country. Getting referrals. I’ve gotten 2 interviews the entire year! I don’t know what to do anymore. \n\nSome context about me and my situation. I moved to America a few years back to do my masters in cybersecurity. I started working for a small company a little more than 2 years back on student visa and I hated it. I absolutely hated the company. I even started doubting my competency because of how they made me feel. And while that was happening I was dealing with visa issues. I got laid off mid process because they didn’t want to handle my visa issues and I wasn’t even sure my OPT would get renewed. Thankfully in the end my OPT worked out but I had lost my job. Now if you know anything about foreign student working in the US you will know how restrictive and difficult it is. You have to get a job in the field of your major.\n\nThis year I applied for a work visa. I very luckily got picked in the H1B lottery. So now my application is being processed and if all goes well I will receive it in October. Now so far I’ve been stressed about not getting a job. It’s hard to find a company that will sponsor my visa and the worst part is plenty of jobs require clearance. Now I know there are tons that don’t. But it’s hard to find a company that sponsors me AND doesn’t require clearance. And even if I find all that I just get rejected. \n\nI’m starting to really believe something is wrong with me. Maybe my resume is not good enough. But everyone I ask to review gives me only minor adjustments but says it’s pretty good. I don’t know what the problem is. People around me tell me it’s not you it’s the market but how can that be the case for so long. If I at least get an interview I can show you myself. If I don’t know something, I will learn said something. If I know it I will show you everything I know. But to not even get a chance to speak to a human is so disheartening. I reach out to tons of people on LinkedIn but hardly anyone responds. Why is it so hard to just talk to people. To get one chance?\n\nSigh, I started therapy to help me regulate my stress and anxiety but that’s gonna take time. I have become extremely socially anxious and I don’t even go out. Every time I step out of the house or meet someone I have to spend money and that stresses me out even more. Every time I talk to people they ask me how my job search is going or what have I been up to. There is only so many times I can say it’s still going just as or nothing much. And everyone gives me suggestions of what I should or should not do. I’ve tried every thing everyone has told me. Nothing helps. And I know they mean well but that’s all everyone talks about with me. I don’t want to hear it anymore unless it actually helps me. Also I feel like, if I don’t apply for jobs that day, I am doing nothing productive and I get stressed out. But that stress is also making me not want to do anything. I’m in my late 20s. Life should not be stressing me out this hard. \n\nI know this is a long rant and is all over the place but it’s been long brewing. \n\nTLDR: I have been looking for a job for months and it’s been stressing me out. \n\nEdit 1: Thank you everyone for your kind words and thoughts. It feels good to know someone hears me and understands me and that I’m not alone in this situation. I did not expect so many responses but I really appreciate every one of you. \n\nEdit 2: Many of you mentioned it might be a problem with my resume or skills. I would love to get your opinions on my resume and how I could improve myself. https://imgur.com/a/7jxqfFb']"

Experience the future of anonymous browsing with MTlogin and take control of your online presence.', 'Any defense against cookie hijacking?\nI recently posted [a similar inquiry on /r/antivirus](https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/1f33jyb/any_defense_against_cookie_hijacking/), but I feel this may be a more appropriate forum.\n\nTo recap, browser session cookie storage in modern desktop operating systems is a gaping security vulnerability. In my use case of Windows 11/Chromium, cookies are stored in a SQL database at *%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Profile 1\\Network\\Cookies*. I believe this similarly affects Linux and MacOS along with other browsers. Any USB ducky, any fool with access to the unlocked PC or unencrypted disk, or any malware can pull this database in a fraction of a second, no admin rights required. If it [happened to LTT](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/24/23654996/linus-tech-tips-channel-hack-session-token-elon-musk-crypto-scam), it can happen to anyone.\n\nThe issue is perpetuated by some apparent case of mass hysteria. The only advice I\'ve been able to find to mitigate this risk amounts to ""log out of your accounts,"" ""don\'t use cookies,"" or ""use 2FA."" 2FA is the only advice approaching any semblance of sensibility, but it fails to get at the heart of the problem which is that cookie storage on all three major desktop operating systems is fundamentally flawed. Android and iOS handle the issue just fine: only system/root apps and the browser itself can access the cookies.\n\nThough desktop operating systems are not designed with the same aggressive level of sandboxing in mind, I am unable to believe that this is an insurmountable problem where the only security advice out there amounts to ""be careful, or better yet just avoid cookies."" Obviously I\'m going to do my best to avoid malware and suspicious USB devices, but I want my computer to have my back at least partially in case something does slip through my judgment.\n\nIn fact, I am certain that this isn\'t an insurmountable problem. I outlined a [procedure in my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antivirus/comments/1f33jyb/any_defense_against_cookie_hijacking/lkb3v69) by which you can create a separate Windows account to be used only by the browser. A shortcut may be added to transparently launch the browser under this separate user account, achieving a partial sandbox. To facilitate browser downloads, the sandbox user may be given access to your primary Windows user account without needing to grant your primary account access to the sandbox account and its entire AppData directory. Cookies are thus isolated from non-admin malware running under the primary account. The only problem is one of convenience: Unless anyone here has any fancy tricks up their sleeve, I see no way to set this sandboxed browser as the default in the primary Windows account. But with official support for a feature of this kind from Microsoft, I\'m sure that could be remedied in short order. The question is, why isn\'t it?\n\n**In conclusion, what are some other practical steps that users can take to reduce the risk of session/cookie hijacking in desktop Web browsers?**', 'Am I hacked? Weird search query in clipboard, perplexity AI, auto form submit, code as image, etc...\nA strange occurrence happened when browsing Perplexity AI\'s main userface (I copied text to put into a new AI chat thread. Upon pasting, an entirely new URL search query was both pasted AND submitted instead). \n\nIt was somewhat relevant to my recent searches but NOT AT ALL relevant to the text I copied. I may not be an expert but I\'m HIGHLY analytical, neurodivergent, observant, etc.... and know this was not normal. The ONLY possible cause I can think of is a glitch, mainly from all the extensions I have downloaded.  (I have perplexity extension as well but never used it). i have extension managers that turn them on and off as well, so I can definitely see how some processes might conflict. \nAnyways, I dug around in the developer console and found some strange things.\n- Code snippets disguised as pictures. One I saw was of a ""try, dalle-3, prompt=prompt. size=1024x1024"" from what I remember\n- My past searches on the internet clumped together and reorganized by context,\n- ""dark_image_url"" which alarmed me at first but then thought maybe it could just signal dark mode image variations. (there were 106 instances of this in the code however)\n-The following two codessnippets  are what I could find with REMOVED in place of what might be sensitive information. Tell me if it\'s malicious in nature or I\'m just seeing too many variables clash and confuse me and it might just be a glitch.\n\nIf anyone can please help me identify/understand how the random search got into my clipboard, and the weird automation of submitting things, Id be GREATLY appreciated. \nALSO, I want to know if any of the below code or above instances sound like I might have malicious code running against my knowledge or on my computer.\n\nPlease don\'t be the person that keeps asking for additional information and for me to send comp specs and all of that. If you can\'t answer the question or point me in the right direction with just the information already provided, then you are unable to answer the question! If you think you might know what it might be and need more info, you can just comment what you think it might be and what info your missing. Just looking for you guys to share or mention your knowledge/impressions on the occurrence that I don\'t have yet. So, creatively and critically brainstorm on this and lend me what you can. Again, I\'m asking for help so that I can figure this out. Not for anyone else to figure it out for me. Though if you can figure it out exactly and post it without asking for additional info, i\'ll be in your debt for sure. But any insight is greatly appreciated.

I have had users who have forgotten their office365 password and do not have their authenticator app. I check if they are logged in on their webmail and if they are, I do the following procedure:\n\n1. go to their initials in the top right > my account > security info > add a new authenticator\n2. Once I add a new authenticator, they can reset their password using the authenticator\n\nMy worry is that if their computer gets hacked, they login on an unsecure device such as a home PC (and it\'s compromised), or a bad actor on premises gains temporary access to their PC when they walk away - They can add an additional authenticator with little effort, then reset the password.\n\nIs there a way to combat this? Such as ""require MFA to add additional MFA methods"". \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Thank you.', 'MS SelfService Reset/MFA\nWhere I work there’s remote access to the network and everyone who forgets their password can go to the Microsoft website and do a SSPR.   For us, we enter our username (which is our email address) and if course not the password.   We get a screen asking if we’d like an MFA code or a voice call with code sent to a phone number we’ve already preregistered with.   Third option is a code sent the MS authenticator app.   We have no device certificate detection (if that’s what it’s called) to identify if logins are originating from a known device.  We claim to have MFA requirements for all remote logins, but I don’t think we actually do when it comes to SSPR.  To be specific, I don’t think the first step (entering a username only) is a first authentication factor at all.  It’s our email address.   The second step (SMS, or voice call to phone-  or code to app) then becomes the first and only authentication factor.  I’m super junior, recently started, so I’m asking here.  Does this smell like complete  MFA to you or not? TIA!', ""Are mobile/cellphone biometrics effectively MFA/2FA?\n* Something you know (password, pin, etc)\n* Something you have (smart card, mobile, etc)\n* Something you are (retina scan, fingerprint, biometrics, etc)\n\nSay I have a mobile app I am creating, and I would like to be able to authenticate an individual via biometrics. Seeing as you need two pieces to even get into the app (something you have (mobile) + something you are (biometrics)), would this not intrinsically constitute two-factor authentication?\n\n**Online research and AI comes up with mixed results on this.** \n\nSome say that an authentication factor has to come from a external device/system/thing for it to be MFA. Easiest example given is that, from your computer, you login to your bank, and are prompted for your password (something you know) and then need to enter a code from your authenticator app (something you have). This is MFA.\n\nBut, security implications aside, an authenticator can exist as a browser extension as well, automatically fulfilling one authentication factor by merely existing in the same ecosystem as the service performing the login. **And technically we still consider it MFA.**\n\nAnd consider this: If you login to your bank from your mobile, you'll likely have your authenticator for the 2FA step on the same mobile device. But, since the authenticator app is separate from the banking app, **we still consider this to be MFA**.\n\nBut if that argument is to be made: Apple FaceID is stored in the Secure Enclave. Android fingerprint is stored in the TEE. These are separate from the banking app. Additionally this data is stored on that one device only. You need both the device with the data, and the biometric data/person, in order for the login to proceed. **Does this not then also constitute MFA?**""]"

Falcon Logscale seems to be up-and-coming, I’ve also heard good things about Panther Labs, among others.\n\nIn my opinion, these are features I think a “modern” SIEM would have (a lot that Splunk also lacks at the moment):\n\n- Compatible with Risk-based type alerting\n- Support for Detection as Code, i.e. version control, validation, integrations with external CI/CD, etc.\n- “Easy” to learn query language with advanced logic functions\n- Ability to throttle and suppress scheduled searches\n- Integrations with popular case management, ticketing, and SOAR tools\n- Capability to create rich dashboards \n\nIs there a product out there that supports these and more, or is there any features I may have missed that you would recommend to pursue?', ""Choosing a SIEM\nCould you please tell me which SIEM you use and why?\n\nThere are a lot of different SIEMs on the market now.

Rocket Cyber is a challenge to work with and I would never recommend them to anyone...within 5 months things have come to a head and we are looking at replacing them.\n\nI'm hoping to get some recommendations here for managed SIEM providers and your experiences working with them. Unfortunately managements initial draw to Rocket Cyber was the very low price point, so I think some of the bigger players out there like Splunk and Log Rhythm are out for us, but basically just need a managed SIEM that is capable of ingesting firewall/switch logs, windows event logs, and can integrate with 365.\n\nAny insight would be much appreciated.""]"

Then through a series of questionable decisions the code was deleted irredeemably. So I rewrote it quickly without those controls. \n\nI've been using the tool for my job, getting docs for software libraries, making obscure git commands, etc.\n\nAt one point I grew curious and asked it to gather as much information about me and the computer as possible. 10 bash commands were loaded up almost instantly, text was flying in the chat. Within a minute it gave me a detailed report on who I am based on disparate files on my computer. This opened my mind to the possibilities of intelligent command line pen testing.\n\nAlong these lines I've been very interested in getting into pen testing. The AI capability has made me realize software dev in on the way out in the next 5 years and honestly I'm already burnt out from writing crud endpoints all day. Anyways.....\n\nI've been tinkering in Kali Linux. It's all just command line arguments. This is not some magic, it's just another program. I know that's obvious but like, the LLM will make short work of this. \n\nLong story short, I'm looking for test servers to pen test that are legal to do so. I saw some sites like hack the box but I'm not sure they actually just give you an IP address, is seems very sandboxed. Any guidance would be lovely.

This will come in the markup stage of the bill, where all sorts of amendments get added. A similar amendment in a Senate bill was dropped late last year. This amendment would task the National Academy to study the issue. The 2023 National Defense Authorization Act mandated Cyber Command to look at “the prospect of a new force generation model,” but in the past has rejected the idea of creating a wholly new service for cyber defense.

The National Cyber Security Centre hopes mandatory reporting will help give the government full visibility into the scale of the ransomware problem.  \n([The Record](https://therecord.media/uk-proposal-mandatory-reporting-ransomware-attacks))\n\n**Rockwell Automation issues ICS warning**  \nThe company warned customers to immediately disconnect all industrial control systems not specifically designed to operate online, citing heightened geopolitical tension and adversarial cyber activity. Rockwell also reiterated that customers take available mitigation measures against known security issues with ICS devices. CISA also boosted this warning in an official alert. None of these alerts list specific threat actors targeting them. But the coordinated nature of the warnings means it wouldn’t be surprising to learn details about specific attacks at some point.  \n([Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rockwell-automation-warns-admins-to-take-ics-devices-offline/))\n\n**Chinese hackers hide on military and government networks for 6 years**  \nThis threat actor, previously unknown and now dubbed ""Unfading Sea Haze"" has been targeting military and government entities in the South China Sea region since 2018 while remaining undetected, according to researchers at BitDefender. Its TTP and toolset appears to overlap with other activity clusters, especially APT41. Its attacks involve spearphishing emails that carry malicious ZIP archives containing LNK files disguised as documents that exploit Microsoft’s MSbuild.exe complier. The interesting twist is that the PowerShell script built into the LNK file builds a working directory on a remote SMB server, so that MSbuild will execute the code it contains entirely in memory, leaving no traces on the victim\'s machine.  \n([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/unfading-sea-haze-hackers-hide-on-military-and-govt-networks-for-6-years/))\n\n**NY Stock Exchange owner fined $10 million by SEC**  \nThe SEC is putting its foot down that nobody or company is above the law. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns nine of the world’s largest financial exchanges including the NY Stock Exchange, failed to report a 2021 cyber incident. The SEC claims the financial giant knew a hacker had inserted malicious code into the corporate network but did not notify any of the subsidiary companies for days. This lack of reporting violated federal regulations and the company\'s own procedures, resulting in this $10 million fine. It should be noted that ICE reported a net revenue of $2.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024.

These customers would be criminals who already possessed a victim’s login credentials to a service but who would also need a one-time-password. OTP.Agency arranged these by making automated, scripted calls to the victim using text-to-speech technology and asking for the temporary password, via spoofed addresses. A video showing how they did what they did is available in the show notes to this episode.  \n([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/admins-of-mfa-bypass-service-plead-guilty-to-fraud/)\xa0and[\xa0NCA video on X](https://x.com/NCA_UK/status/1829807163121733905))\n\n**SQL injection able to bypass airport TSA security checks**  \nTwo security researchers have identified a vulnerability in a security system that according to BleepingComputer, “allowed unauthorized individuals to potentially bypass airport security screenings and gain access to aircraft cockpits.” The researchers, Ian Carroll and Sam Curry, found the vulnerability within a third-party web-based service called FlyCASS which stands for Cockpit Access Security System (CASS). Some airlines use it to manage their Known Crewmember (KCM) program, which itself is a TSA initiative that “allows pilots and flight attendants to skip security screening, and also allows authorized pilots to use jump seats in cockpits when traveling.” The researchers saw that the FlyCASS login system was susceptible to SQL injection, which allowed them to log in as an administrator for a participating airline, and manipulate employee data within the system.  \n([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researchers-find-sql-injection-to-bypass-airport-tsa-security-checks/))\n\n**Halliburton confirms data stolen in cyberattack**  \nFollowing up on a story we brought to you[\xa0last week on Cyber Security Headlines](https://cisoseries.com/cybersecurity-news-halliburton-suffers-cyberattack-telegram-ceo-arrested-georgia-tech-lawsuit/), the U.S. oil service giant confirmed Tuesday that corporate data was stolen from its computer systems during a ransomware attack it suffered in August. Halliburton stopped short of confirming a ransomware extortion scheme but said significant portions of its IT systems were disrupted. The company said it engaged law enforcement to help identify exactly what data was stolen and who they will need to notify. The company’s acknowledgement comes on the heels of CISA, the FBI, and HHS blaming the RansomHub gang for the attack.  \n([SecurityWeek](https://www.securityweek.com/halliburton-data-theft/))\n\n**City of Columbus sues researcher after ransomware attack**  \nAfter suffering a ransomware attack in mid-July, the city of Columbus, Ohio is now suing a security researcher. Initially, city officials said they had thwarted the attack but later conceded that attackers had indeed stolen data and encrypted its systems. This after the Rhysida ransomware gang leaked 3.1 TB of data they claimed to have stolen from Columbus’ systems. Security researcher David Leroy Ross (also known as Connor Goodwolf) took to the media claiming the city wasn’t telling the full truth and that stolen data included names, Social Security numbers, and other data related to police officers and crime victims. The city has now accused Ross of colluding with the threat actors to obtain access to the stolen data which they say is also an invasion of privacy. An Ohio judge has granted a temporary restraining order to prevent Ross from disseminating data from Rhysida’s site but does not bar him from discussing the incident with the media.  \n([Dark Reading](https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/city-of-columbus-sues-researcher-after-ransomware-attack))\n\n**GitHub comments push malware masked as fixes**  \nThe Lumma Stealer information-stealing malware is being distributed via comments being posted in GitHub, disguised as solutions to users’ project questions. The solution, which according to one researcher was sent out 29,000 times over a three day period, tells people to “download a password-protected archive from a specific website and run the executable within it. The password is supplied in the message. The downloaded malware aims to steal “cookies, credentials, passwords, credit cards, and browsing history from Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and other Chromium browsers,” as well as cryptocurrency wallets, private keys, and text files.  \n([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-comments-abused-to-push-password-stealing-malware-masked-as-fixes/))\n\n**DrayTek added to CISA KEV catalog**  \nThe addition to the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog refers to DrayTek VigorConnect, a management software for DrayTek network equipment. Its flaws, which were discovered by researchers at Tenable in 2021, are described as “path traversal issues that can allow an unauthenticated attacker to download arbitrary files from the underlying operating system with root privileges.” They were patched in October 2021. Researchers at FortiGuard Labs say they have seen the vulnerability being exploited this year in “a worldwide campaign targeting various industries, including finance payroll, networking, manufacturing, real estate, telecom, technology storage, software and hardware companies). They do not believe that these recent attacks are the work of a specific group, but rather “multiple threat actor groups trying to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data from affected organizations.”  \n([Security Week](https://www.securityweek.com/draytek-vulnerabilities-added-to-cisa-kev-catalog-exploited-in-global-campaign/))\n\n**OnlyFans malware spins a duplicitous web**  \nResearchers at security firm Veriti have discovered a new distribution mechanism for infostealer malware: a “checker” tool used by hackers to validate stolen credentials. The OnlyFans connection comes from the fact that the checker tool provides cybercriminals with the ability to “validate OnlyFans logins, check account balances, verify if accounts have payment methods attached and determine if accounts have creator privileges.” However, Veriti says this same checker tool is also a delivery mechanism for Lumma Stealer, which buries itself deep within the systems owned by other cybercriminals. The checker tool has also been used on hackers who target accounts on Disney+ and Instagram.  \n([InfoSecurity Magazine](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/onlyfans-hackers-targeted/))"", 'Top cybersecurity stories for the week of 04-08-24 to 04-12-24\nBelow are some of the stories we’ve been reporting this week on Cyber Security Headlines.\n\nIf you’d like to watch and participate in a discussion about them, the CISO Series does a live 20-minute show every Friday at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET.

According to BleepingComputer, “the threat actors use a local area code to call organizations”\xa0 including using voice cloning techniques, pretending to be employees in the financial department. They provide stolen ID verification details, including corporate ID and social security numbers. Using this sensitive information and claiming their smartphone is broken, they convince the IT helpdesk to enroll a new device in MFA under the attacker’s control.” No group has yet been associated with these attacks, but the name Scattered Spider does keep coming up.  \n([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-health-dept-warns-hospitals-of-hackers-targeting-it-help-desks/))\n\n**Sisense breach exposes customers to potential supply chain attack**  \nThe breach that affected the well-known manufacturer of business analytics software is sufficiently important to prompt CISA to issue an alert. According to Cyberscoop, “although the details of the attack are not yet clear, the breach may have exposed hundreds of Sisense’s customers to a supply chain attack and provided the attacker with a door into the company’s customer networks.” The CISA alert strongly recommends that Sisense customers reset credentials that may be “exposed to, or used to access, Sisense services.” Cybersecurity researcher Marc Rogers has urged current and former customers of Sisense to “not underestimate the risk” posed by the breach.  \n([Cyberscoop](https://cyberscoop.com/sisense-supply-chain-breach/))\n\n**Financial firms lose $12 billion to cyberattacks in two decades**  \nThis number comes from the International Monetary Fund and represents losses from 20,000 cyberattacks. The data is contained in its April 2024 Global Financial Stability Report. The report continues by pointing out that “financial organizations are at the receiving end of roughly one fifth of all cyberattacks, with cybercriminals seeking to steal money or disrupt economic activities.” It predicts that “reliance on third-party IT services providers and the rise of AI use could expose financial institutions to additional risks, such as outages caused by ransomware attacks on the service providers, and AI-related data leaks.” A link to the report is available in the show notes to this episode.  \n([IMF April 2024 Global Financial Stability Report](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/GFSR/Issues/2024/04/16/global-financial-stability-report-april-2024))\n\n**Microsoft exposed internal passwords in security lapse**  \nOn February 6th, security researchers notified Microsoft that they discovered an unsecured Azure cloud storage server. The server contained info relating to Microsoft’s Bing search engine as well as code, scripts and configuration files containing passwords, keys and credentials used by Microsoft employees for accessing other internal databases and systems. The storage server was not protected with a password and could be accessed by virtually anyone on the internet. Microsoft secured the exposed files on March 5 but did not say whether it had reset or changed any of the exposed internal credentials. It’s also unclear how long the cloud server was exposed to the internet.  \n([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/microsoft-employees-exposed-internal-passwords-security-lapse/))\n\n**Hackers using infected devices to hunt for vulnerabilities**  \nVulnerability scanning has long been a key reconnaissance step for malicious actors looking to deploy cyber-attacks. However, researchers at Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 say that in 2023 a growing number of threat actors conducted their vulnerability scanning activity from a previously compromised devices. The researchers identified vulnerability scanning clusters targeting vulnerabilities in commodity products such as Ivanti’s Connect Secure and Policy Secure solutions and Progress’ MOVEit Transfer. This malware-based vulnerability scanning tactic allows threat actors to better cover their tracks by bypassing geofencing and to scale their operations by generating higher scan volumes using compromised devices.  \n([Infosecurity Magazine](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/malware-hunt-software/))\n\n**Over 90,000 LG Smart TVs exposed to remote attacks**  \nSecurity researchers have discovered four vulnerabilities impacting multiple versions of the operating system used in LG smart TVs. The flaws in LG’s WebOS enable authorization bypass, privilege escalation, and command injection. Exploiting these flaws could allow a threat actor to take control of services on the device, pivot to more sensitive devices connected to the same network, or enlist devices into malware botnets or cryptomining schemes. Shodan internet scans have identified 91,000 exposed and potentially vulnerable devices. Though LG TVs alert users when important WebOS updates are available, those can be postponed indefinitely. Users should apply updates by going to the TV\'s Settings > Support > Software Update, and selecting ""Check for Update.""  \n([BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-90-000-lg-smart-tvs-may-be-exposed-to-remote-attacks/))\n\n**Chip maker says Taiwan earthquake will affect its DRAM supply**  \nMicron Technology stated yesterday that the April 3 earthquake in Taiwan will hurt a calendar quarter of its dynamic random access memory supply.

By executing a desired use-case and collecting code coverage, you can effectively narrow down the sections of the binary to refine your understanding of the program. While dealing with a MIPS binary reversing challenge, I came across a tool called Cannoli, which provides tracing capability in Qemu User-mode. It allows you to write plugins to trace execution paths and memory operations like read and write. What’s most fascinating about this tool is not just what it does (as there are other tools that also do this), but how quickly and elegantly it accomplishes its tasks. In other words, I was captivated by its engineering.    \n    \nThe tool’s author patched Qemu to expose some of its internal functions, allowing you to inject your own code into the JIT code emitted by Qemu for execution. This is achieved by providing two callbacks: one before an instruction is lifted and another before an instruction performing a memory operation is lifted in Qemu. The real work is done by the code you inject into the JIT code. This custom code exposes execution trace and memory operation data via IPC to another process, which then post-processes this data.    \n    \nEssentially, you’ll be writing the data consumer library that is sent via IPC. The IPC design is also interesting. It uses shared memory-based IPC, where you allocate a large block of memory that is divided into smaller chunks. The idea is to use chunk sizes that match your CPU cache size to avoid cache misses, thereby improving performance. The design supports a single producer and multiple consumers. A single write-only chunk is available to the producer, and once the producer is done, it releases the buffer to be consumed. The consumers then post-process the data, clear it, and release the memory chunk to be reused by the producer.    \n    \nOne important thing to note is that this tool doesn’t allow you to modify the behavior of the executing program; it only allows you to observe the program’s behavior. Despite this, it’s still a very powerful tool. All of this is achieved by introducing about \\~200 lines of code into QEMU. There’s a lot more to discuss about this tool that can’t fit into this small post. I would recommend checking out the project link and the blog post that discusses these tools in depth.  \nProject link : https://github.com/MarginResearch/cannoli  \nhttps://margin.re/2022/05/cannoli-the-fast-qemu-tracer/  \nhttps://margin.re/2023/02/harness-the-power-of-cannoli/', ""AntiCrack-DotNet: Advanced Methods to prevent cracking.\n[AntiCrack-DotNet](https://github.com/AdvDebug/AntiCrack-DotNet) is a .NET Project which Contains some useful techniques to detect debugging and other harmful actions and bypass methods which can be used by crackers to analyze your assembly, with syscall support.\n\n# Anti-Debugging\n\n* NtUserGetForegroundWindow (looks for bad active window names to check if it's a known debugger)\n* Debugger.IsAttached\n* Hide Threads From Debugger\n* IsDebuggerPresent\n* NtSetDebugFilterState\n* Page Guard Breakpoints Detection\n* NtQueryInformationProcess: ProcessDebugFlags, ProcessDebugPort, ProcessDebugObjectHandle\n* NtClose: Invalid Handle, Protected Handle\n* Parent Process Checking (Checks if parent are explorer.exe or cmd.exe)\n* Detection of Hardware Breakpoints\n* FindWindow (looks for bad window names)\n* GetTickCount\n* OutputDebugString\n* Crashing Non-Managed Debuggers with a Debugger Breakpoint\n* OllyDbg Format String Exploit\n* Patching DbgUiRemoteBreakin and DbgBreakPoint (Anti-Debugger Attaching)\n\n# Anti Virtualization\n\n* Detecting [Any.run](http://Any.run)\n* Detecting Triage\n* Detecting Qemu.\n* Detecting Parallels.\n* Detecting Sandboxie\n* Detecting Comodo Container\n* Detecting Qihoo360 Sandbox\n* Detecting Cuckoo Sandbox\n* Detecting VirtualBox and VMware\n* Detecting HyperV\n* Detecting Emulation\n* Checking For Blacklisted Usernames\n* Detecting KVM\n* Detecting Wine\n* Checking For Known Bad VM File Locations\n* Checking For Known Bad Process Names\n* Checking For Ports on the system (useful if the VM or the sandbox have no ports connected)\n* Checking for devices created by VMs or Sandboxes\n\n# Anti Dll Injection\n\n* Taking Advantage of Binary Image Signature Mitigation Policy to prevent injecting Non-Microsoft Binaries.\n* Checking if any injected libraries are present (simple dlls path whitelist check)\n\n# Other Detections\n\n* Detecting Most Anti Anti-Debugging Hooking Methods on Common Anti-Debugging Functions by checking for Bad Instructions on Functions Addresses and it detects user-mode anti anti-debuggers like scyllahide, and it can also detect some sandboxes which uses hooking to monitor application behaviour/activity (like Sandboxie/Sandboxie Plus, Hybrid Analysis, Cuckoo Sandbox, and a lot of other online malware analysis websites/applications).\n* Detecting CLR Functions Hooking (like harmony hooks)."", 'Cuckoo3 Sandbox - reports of jobs seems to be swaped\nHay guys,\n\nfirst a happy new year.\n\nI installed a cuckoo3 sandbox to learn new cybersecurity stuff with this tutorial: [https://reversingfun.com/posts/cuckoo-3-installation-guide/](https://reversingfun.com/posts/cuckoo-3-installation-guide/) (I did not run the postinstallation guide, because i think i do not need a webserver for learning - so i run the submits \\[at the moment just urls\\] in cli or api mode)\n\nI have solved all dependencys errors and installed it.\n\nWhen i scan one after another the reports seems to be switched.

Share your stories and any lessons you learned from them. Let’s get some interesting discussions going!\n\nLooking forward to hearing your experiences!', ""What are the Major Types of Cybersecurity Threats for Business\nLet's delve into the major types of cybersecurity threats, why hackers target SMEs, how to assess your business's risk, cybersecurity best practices, and practical steps to protect your business.\n\n**Phishing Attacks:** Phishing remains one of the top threats, where cybercriminals trick employees into revealing sensitive information such as login credentials or financial data through deceptive emails, messages, or websites.\n\n**Ransomware:** Ransomware attacks have surged in recent years, where malicious software encrypts a company's data and demands a ransom for its release. These attacks can cause significant disruption and financial losses.\n\n**Data Breaches:** Data breaches involve unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as customer data, intellectual property, or financial records. Breaches can occur due to various factors, including weak security controls, insider threats, or malware.\n\n**Insider Threats:** Insider threats can come from current or former employees, contractors, or business partners who misuse their access privileges to steal data, sabotage systems, or cause other harm to the organization.\n\n**Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):** APTs are sophisticated and targeted attacks usually orchestrated by nation-states or highly organized cybercriminal groups. These attacks are often stealthy, persistent, and aimed at compromising sensitive information or disrupting operations over an extended period.\n\n**IoT Vulnerabilities:** The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices introduces new security risks, as many of these devices lack robust security features and are vulnerable to exploitation. Compromised IoT devices can be used to launch large-scale attacks or infiltrate corporate networks.\n\n**Social Engineering:** Social engineering tactics manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Techniques like pretexting, baiting, or tailgating exploit human psychology to bypass technical safeguards.\n\n**Zero-Day Exploits:** Zero-day exploits target vulnerabilities in software or hardware that are unknown to the vendor or not yet patched. Cybercriminals exploit these vulnerabilities to launch attacks before security patches are released, leaving organizations vulnerable to exploitation.\n\n**How to Assess Your Business's Risk:**\n\n* **Conduct Regular Audits:** Evaluate existing cybersecurity measures, identify vulnerabilities, and prioritize areas for improvement.\n* **Assess Threat Landscape:** Stay informed about emerging cyber threats relevant to your industry and business model.\n* **Engage Experts:** Consider hiring cybersecurity professionals to conduct thorough risk assessments and provide tailored solutions.\n\n**Cybersecurity Best Practices:**\n\n* **Employee Training:** Educate employees on cybersecurity protocols, including password hygiene, recognizing phishing attempts, and data handling procedures.\n* **Implement Strong Password Policies:** Enforce complex passwords and multi-factor authentication to enhance account security.\n* **Regular Updates and Patch Management:** Keep software, operating systems, and security protocols up-to-date to mitigate vulnerabilities.\n\n**How to Protect Your Business:**\n\n* **Invest in Cybersecurity Solutions:** Deploy firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and encryption tools to fortify your defenses. \n* **Backup and Recovery Plans:** Regularly back up critical data and develop robust recovery strategies to minimize downtime in the event of a breach.\n*  **Incident Response Plan:** Establish protocols for detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber attacks, ensuring swift and effective action.\n\nIn conclusion, cybersecurity is an ongoing priority for businesses of all sizes. By understanding the major threats, assessing risks, implementing best practices, and adopting proactive measures, SMEs can bolster their defenses and safeguard their assets against [cyber threats](https://www.extnoc.com/cyber-threat-monitoring/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=cyberthreat_cta).
