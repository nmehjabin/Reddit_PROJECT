I should be more grateful to have the role that I do. The people are nice, they let me work hybrid (mostly from home, few days in office here and there), and I feel more or less appreciated for the things I do.

On the other hand, it's hard to think of the last time I had a low-key day where I wasn't working on an active project and could catch up on learning. I guess there were one or two days here and there over the past 2-3 months. As I finish my ongoing project, I can see the next one(s) coming in the pipeline, and I feel dread.

I am fairly certain that other people are not working on anything, or at least are getting much more downtime, and this makes me feel bitter. Some projects are vastly different than others and require learning so many new things in short periods of time that I feel like I am lost and drowning. Some projects have many stalls caused by client issues, then they flip out and try to rush us through the actual work.

I can't easily leave because postings for similar roles ask for several years experience and certifications that I don't have. I don't even confident in my abilities anymore to actually apply and interview elsewhere.

Personal support in a different sense lol.

Decades ago, when I started out, I’ve heard that professionals in IT security burn out after about 10 years.  I’ve been in the field for 25 years. I think there needs to be different severity levels of burnout. 

If I could quit working altogether,  I would walk away, and never look back.

Sages, gurus and veterans of the field, how do you deal with the fact that nobody, including management, CISOs,  friends, coworkers, literally anybody in your life do not care about the job you do, as long as you don’t cause them any more work, as long as you don’t make them feel bad in any way, shape or form (unintentionally, just by nature of your profession), that you’re just a risk documenter, resource unit, warm body, a cog in the wheel of compliance, etc?

And don’t tell me that you like the pay (same), “it is what it is”, “nothing I can do”, etc. how do you actually manage to compartmentalize?

How do you keep away your frustration and disappointment from your significant others, families, etc.?

What hobbies do you have to help you cope?

I’ve picked up a number of them in the past few years, but I sometimes have a hard time even focusing on them, because sometimes my doubts in my purpose in this field are really strong, and distract me from being able to focus on other things. 

The fact that literally nobody cares whatsoever, I am mostly used to it, but sometimes it really gets to me.

Thanks.

My issue with burnout articles is they tend to offer vague suggestions and end with a sales pitch. Honestly the key is in the Serenity Prayer: accept the things you cannot change, be brave enough to change what you can, and be wise enough to know the difference.

Start with Root Cause: Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, and Greater Good say the top causes of burnout are:

In 2022, a study by Yerbo found over 40% of tech workers have felt burnout and were ready to quit.  
  
My issue with burnout articles is they tend to offer vague suggestions and end with a sales pitch. Honestly the key is in the Serenity Prayer: accept the things you cannot change, be brave enough to change what you can, and be wise enough to know the difference.

Start with Root Cause: Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, and Greater Good say the top causes of burnout are:  
·       Perceived lack of control  
·       Lack of clear expectations of you or the role  
·       Heavy workloads/Unreasonable deadlines  
·       Poor relationships/Lack of support/Unfair treatment

I have been struggling with burnout after accepting a ""promotion"" to senior security engineer (I'm the only engineer) around 2 years ago.

I work at a small MSSP, 1 vCISO, 1 security architect, 1 engineer and 2 analysts that supports around 8 enterprises (in various sectors) with around 10k users total. All of the organizations use M365 (Office, Entra, Intune, Defender) and I am in charge and the main point of contact for all incidents and issues with any of our service (security related or not) and responsible for planning, deploying, updating, and supporting all configs and maintaining all documentation.

This includes Defender for Endpoint, cloud apps, Identity, Sentinel, Azure, Admin portal, Intune, Entra ID, Cisco Meraki, Cisco endpoint protection, Carbon Black, MDR portal, logic apps automation, conditional access, and others.

I also am in charge of our threat Analysts, assigning them responsibilities, creating and maintaining playbooks for them to follow, leading incident response, training them, and assisting with their day to day alert response (all alerts from the security tools are sent to our messaging tool for the analysts to review).

In the past year I've had to spend a lot of time studying for and earning the SSCP and re-earning the Security+.

A lot of my free time is gradually getting eaten up by this job.

Things that are eating up my free time:

1.) Having to study for and earn Linux+ before the year is out. This is done after 5PM and on weekends.

2.) Having to earn a Splunk certificate before the year is out. This is also done after 5PM and on weekends.

3.) Becoming an expert on Application Security. In addition to working on the other two other requirements from my job listed above, I've been told I should be studying and absorbing information on AppSec. So, I've been doing that too - off hours, as requested.

4.) Return to office. I'm now losing at least an hour a week of personal time from the commute to the office. More days will be required soon too, from what I've been told as we're said the goal is to get everyone back in 5 days a week. 

5.) Getting late night calls when alerts go off.

6.) Getting more and more tasks assigned to me that can only be done after hours and on weekends (running scans, validating changes work, and so on).



I'm not 100% sure this is the career path for me if this is going to be the next 20 years of my life, and that's fine. I don't know if I should try to look for other cyber security jobs at other companies, or if this is par for the course in the field and I need to adjust my study plan to migrate into something else career wise.

  
Can you provide me with honest input? I'm okay with being told I'm not cut out for this line of work. I just feel like bit by bit I'm losing the ability to spend time with my family and friends, and I'm even seeing a mental health counselor at this point too because I'm so miserable.","Burnout - CS Career Questions

Here is an AI summary of the book:

Cal Newport's ""Slow Productivity"" offers a new philosophy for achieving meaningful work without burnout, based on three key principles:

1. Do fewer things: Newport advocates for reducing commitments and obligations to focus on what truly matters. This approach allows for better results by enabling workers to concentrate on high-value tasks rather than simply being busy.
2. Work at a natural pace: Instead of constant urgency, Newport suggests giving important work the time it needs. This principle recognizes that humans are not wired for unceasing intensity, and that a more varied, natural pace leads to sustainable productivity in the long term. Strategies include making longer-term plans, doubling project timeline estimates, and introducing ""seasonality"" into work schedules.
3. Obsess over quality: Newport emphasizes the importance of producing high-quality work, even if it means missing short-term opportunities. This focus on quality both demands and enables a slower pace, leading to more meaningful career results over time.

The book argues that the modern approach to knowledge work, which often emphasizes constant activity and urgency, is unsustainable and ineffective. Instead, Newport proposes a more intentional and deliberate approach to work that aligns better with human nature and leads to more fulfilling and productive outcomes.""Slow Productivity"" challenges the culture of overwork and constant hustle, offering an alternative that aims to make work a source of meaning rather than overwhelm while still maintaining valuable output. By implementing these principles, Newport suggests that individuals can achieve better results, experience greater satisfaction in their work, and avoid burnout.","Have you read Slow Productivity by Cal Newport?

Burnout and Impostor Syndrome will happen several times in a security career. While many ask about *how* to overcome it, the real question is *why* *does this happen?*

IMO, the main reason is we have very demotivational work in a misunderstood field. Our field is powered by negativity, justified with skepticism, and influenced by those who don't work with us on a daily basis.

We stop bad things from happening. An exciting day at work usually involves a crime, e.g., the organization we've been tasked with defending was attacked. A good day usually means our designs worked, but nobody noticed because they were able to do their jobs.

Breaches are happening everywhere and nobody seems to get punished effectively for it. In fact, *some get jobs* - by the very government asking us to defend better - *because of it*.

Tech is evolving faster than any other field, innovative companies are trying to adopt it a few months after initial release, and we need to be at least 3 months ahead of it, which means researching beta releases and conceiving the guardrails for something that may not even be a thing.

On a personal relations level, we're not a fun group to work with. People don't like dealing with password changes, MFA, firewall rules that block them from uploading files to customers, mandatory email encryption, etc. because we get in their way.

Audits ain't fun: It's not what you did, it's what you can prove you did. You have to back up every claim with documentation, logs, etc., that you typically don't think about unless you've failed an audit before. The auditors rarely know the ins and outs of how much effort it takes to meet compliance (regardless of what some will say, it is not easy) and they've got the ear of the BoD.

Finally, there's the cost. Breaches are expensive, so we're expensive. It's not difficult to see why the CFO scrutinizes our expenses when there's not any revenue coming in from the cyber folks. As messed up as it sounds in this forum, it makes financial sense to weigh ""how much would the ransom cost?"" vs. ""how much do these 4 technologies to mitigate ransomware risk cost?""

When we get out of our rhythm and look at our own situation it's easy to stare off and ask ""why do I bother doing this?"" ...and **that's** when the burnout starts.

**So how do we counteract the above? By remembering the reason we wanted to do this in the first place. FIND YOUR WHY** (supporting your family? being on the edge of tech? protecting people?)**, print it, and use it for motivation.**

And, for the love of all things holy, have a sense of humor about it. Laugh or you'll cry.

The Simpsons did exactly that in ""[And Maggie Makes Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Maggie_Makes_Three).""","Regarding burnout: Understanding WHY is paramount

So I just took a federal job as an ISSM and I had a bad feeling since day one. Let me lay the situation out for you. My previous job was in the private sector at a large defense contractor where I was an ISSE. I loved my job and I loved the company, but with any private company you have its cons. My reason for leaving was simply because it was a federal job, which offered job security, better benefits, and ability to have a pension.

While all of those points are awesome, does it matter if you hate the job? I am a highly technical person and I enjoy being in the systems and working, which is what my last job was. This new one is a compliance role, which is just a bunch of paperwork and pushing policies on programs that I support. On day one my manager was complaining all day, saying how this work sucks, the people suck, and how she cant wait until she is done with it and or retires. The pay is comparable as they matched my pay so that isn't one of my concerns.

* Federal Job:
   * Pros:
      * Better benefits
      * Job Security
      * Ability to invest into a pension
      * Every other Friday off, and ability to telecommute 50%
   * Cons:
      * I hate the work, I don't feel like I would be proficient in it and I have no interest in it.
      * The people do not seem excited or motivated to be there
      * My manager told me she hopes I do good so I can help pick up the slack of others
      * Pay as you progress in your career isnt as good as in the private sector.
* Previous Job:
   * Pros:
      * I enjoyed the work and got every Friday off
      * The people were excited to be there and wanted to work
      * Fully Remote and can live anywhere in the US
      * Wasn't super stressful like I know the Federal job will be
   * Cons:
      * Potential layoffs/restructuring as you have with any private company
      * Health benefits aren't nearly as good, but they offer an amazing 401k and HSA program

I need advice because in my head, going back is the move. But I know I should give this new role some time for the new job blues to pass, but if I do that, my old position is gone within 2 weeks. I am at a loss and have never been this stressed over a job before, and I half feel stupid for feeling this way. Any advice is good advice here.","I am stressing over new ISSM role - Previously ISSE
