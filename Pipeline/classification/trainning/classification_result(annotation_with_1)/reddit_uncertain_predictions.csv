I'm about to finish my Bachelor's degree and contemplating the next step – whether to pursue a Master's degree (in IT/CS/IT-Sec) or certifications (e.g., OSCP).

My goal is to stay in a technical role for the next 5-6 years (at least), leaning towards the blue team/engineering/architectural side (basically what I currently do). I plan to work full-time while obtaining either the Master's degree or certifications during my spare time, as experience > everything.

Additional info:

* Most likely leaving my current employer later this year, so their advice may not be as relevant (they don't really care about degrees or certs).
* Interested in roles at other US BigTech/FAANG companies.
* Cost is manageable for both options (\~20k for Master's, ? for certs); i.e., spending as little as possible isn't my highest priority. I'm not relying on my employer to pay for it.
* From what I have seen in job postings, Master's degrees aren't commonly listed as requirements for technical roles; certs occasionally are.

I'd appreciate your insights on whether another \~2 years for a Master's degree is worth it, considering tthe additional value they provide for the time I need to invest.   
If you recommend certifications, which ones would make the most sense? I'd consider OSCP, but I'm unsure about other certifications. CISSP is on the radar, but I have 2 years left before I can take it.

And it got me thinking:  the older one gets, the harder it is to keep up with the evolving threat landscapes, regulatory changes, business operating environments, budget and staff cuts and many other things that really impact how a business manages their IT Security.  

For those who are young and starting out, maybe this is not a big deal and such persons are likely to be able to land on their feet should they take a fall.  Such persons are likely to pick up new skills faster and be more employable.

But for those who have been in the field in one way or another for like 20+ years are probably in their mid 40's/early 50's now - basically too old (and expensive) to get decent employment elsewhere, too young to qualify for retirement, and probably peaked career and salary-wise.  So if the burnout hits, it can hit hard and fast when you have likely have hit a brick wall but in denial.  

Also at this 45-55 age range, people have family commitments, significant financial obligations and cannot just head for the exit like that.  On the flip side if they are asked to leave from their current roles, they may not be able to sort out a plan B in a timely manner - so really a double whammy.

Furthermore, when I see yesterday's announcement of Palo Alto forecasting lower future earnings, despite heightend cyber risk (sending their stock prices lower by like 20% on the day), it further suggests that businesses everywhere are cutting their cyber-spend and taking on higher tolerances (sacrifices) on cyber risk.  This basically translates into budget/staff cuts, lower investments in tech and hiring freezes.  

So the wider industry is somewhat in pain.  And this pain may be felt by the more senior folks (they're senior, but too young to be boomers!) in this field than the young and upcomers.

So I wanted to start a discussion if there are persons here who think of leaving the field altogether and do something else?  Do you have an exit strategy in mind?  What would you leave a decent paying cyber role for? Would you perhaps use your experience to stay in cyber but work as a freelancer?

I recently left a senior cyber position at a multinational to start my own physical commodity trading firm (mainly agricultural staples, edible oils and such).  Totallly unrelated field and it makes less money, but I'm happier at least.  I've certainly learned more about how the world operates and got a better grasp on global geopolitics and macroeconomics through this than I ever have through all my years as a corporate drone at least!

What about your thoughts?  How do you feel on the state of the industry and whether or not you have the drive and energy to keep at it?","Exit Strategies for the Senior Security Pro's (i.e. Managers, VP's, CISO's, BISO's etc.)

Bloat in software refers to the presence of unnecessary or excessive features and code. This can make the software large, slow, and more complex than needed, often reducing its efficiency and effectiveness.

**Why Bloat Is Still Software’s Biggest Vulnerability?**

**Increased Attack Surface:** Software bloat, with its unnecessary features and code, enlarges the attack surface for potential exploits. This complexity adds more entry points for hackers, making it harder to secure and monitor all vulnerabilities.

**Resource Inefficiency:** Bloated software demands more system resources, leading to inefficiency. It consumes excessive memory, CPU, and storage, affecting system performance and reliability, and often results in a slower, less responsive user experience.

**Complexity in Maintenance and Updates:** The more bloated a software is, the more challenging it becomes to maintain and update. Each additional feature or line of code adds potential for bugs and errors, making updates more cumbersome and error-prone.

**Reduced User Trust and Satisfaction:** Users often perceive bloated software as sluggish and unresponsive, leading to frustration and reduced trust. This negative user experience can decrease software popularity and affect the developer's reputation.","4 Reasons Why Software Bloat is a Cybersecurity Nightmare

I also handle risk management tasks, such as business continuity policies.

I’m a Cybersec Analyst for a small company right now. My manager is my mentor / professor from my bootcamp. In my recent review he told me I was getting complacent and need to make sure I’m branching out enough to get “the next job” if and when the time comes. 

I work to live, I definitely don’t live to work. I’m an artist that had to give it up on account of having no money at all. I can see how I’ve been sort of clocking in doing work and clocking out but I don’t really know how to not do that/what I should be doing.

I’m about to hit one year as a cybersec professional, I have my Sec+ but the only other certs I have are ISC CC , AZ900, and I’m taking the AZ 104 soon (hopefully before my one year mark).Ny manager has helped me plan my next certifications but I know I need to do more than just test.

I was told to join groups but which groups ? And what should I be doing in them ? I’m an introvert but I’m not shy (usually), so it’s harder for me to be social and know if I’m doing it right.

Also , does the imposter syndrome go away. Anytime I can’t answer a technical question I feel like I conned my way into this job. Is that normal?","How to avoid complacency?

Well, found out we are being laid off and company is moving most of its security roles to India including some other non tech roles. At least the severance package is actually pretty good. I'm honestly just so tired of this, I know that these corporations only care about profit, but wont with all these white collar jobs going overseas cause a economic disparity here back home? I mean doesn't the government see the possible security and financial implications of this? Less taxes going to government and so forth, US intellectual property going to foreign hands.

It/SecOps colleagues will repeat that policies will not protect the company from an attack, making us understand they consider our meetings a waste of time.

We don't have a single Risk Register. The Risk Management Team (outside of the InfoSec) does nothing but we still have to check that we are aligned with them. A few weeks ago I created a risk register in excel, because they will soon remove the only software we have with Integrated Risk Management.

At this point I’m just so tired and stressed and anxious and depressed. I lost my job last November and I have been looking for so long. Trying everything I can. Reaching out to people on linked. Applying for jobs everywhere, all over the country. Getting referrals. I’ve gotten 2 interviews the entire year! I don’t know what to do anymore. 

Some context about me and my situation. I moved to America a few years back to do my masters in cybersecurity. I started working for a small company a little more than 2 years back on student visa and I hated it. I absolutely hated the company. I even started doubting my competency because of how they made me feel. And while that was happening I was dealing with visa issues. I got laid off mid process because they didn’t want to handle my visa issues and I wasn’t even sure my OPT would get renewed. Thankfully in the end my OPT worked out but I had lost my job. Now if you know anything about foreign student working in the US you will know how restrictive and difficult it is. You have to get a job in the field of your major.

This year I applied for a work visa. I very luckily got picked in the H1B lottery. So now my application is being processed and if all goes well I will receive it in October. Now so far I’ve been stressed about not getting a job. It’s hard to find a company that will sponsor my visa and the worst part is plenty of jobs require clearance. Now I know there are tons that don’t. But it’s hard to find a company that sponsors me AND doesn’t require clearance. And even if I find all that I just get rejected. 

I’m starting to really believe something is wrong with me. Maybe my resume is not good enough. But everyone I ask to review gives me only minor adjustments but says it’s pretty good. I don’t know what the problem is. People around me tell me it’s not you it’s the market but how can that be the case for so long. If I at least get an interview I can show you myself. If I don’t know something, I will learn said something. If I know it I will show you everything I know. But to not even get a chance to speak to a human is so disheartening. I reach out to tons of people on LinkedIn but hardly anyone responds. Why is it so hard to just talk to people. To get one chance?

Sigh, I started therapy to help me regulate my stress and anxiety but that’s gonna take time. I have become extremely socially anxious and I don’t even go out. Every time I step out of the house or meet someone I have to spend money and that stresses me out even more. Every time I talk to people they ask me how my job search is going or what have I been up to. There is only so many times I can say it’s still going just as or nothing much. And everyone gives me suggestions of what I should or should not do. I’ve tried every thing everyone has told me. Nothing helps. And I know they mean well but that’s all everyone talks about with me. I don’t want to hear it anymore unless it actually helps me. Also I feel like, if I don’t apply for jobs that day, I am doing nothing productive and I get stressed out. But that stress is also making me not want to do anything. I’m in my late 20s. Life should not be stressing me out this hard. 

I know this is a long rant and is all over the place but it’s been long brewing. 

TLDR: I have been looking for a job for months and it’s been stressing me out.

1fjvmnj,cybersecurity,TruthPuzzleheaded757,2024-09-18 15:29:04,1726673344,"Burntout and unfulfilled, considering career change","Hi, hoping to generate some perspective and ideas about this situation.

  
Quick background: Early 30s, graduated with a B.S. in Cybersec a few years ago. Final four semesters were also spent working as a student mentor for a government funded grant program given to my school to host a college-level credit offering ""cybersec intro"" course for high school students (only noting this as a CIA rep I spoke to said this is highly appealing to any govt-sector hiring process). 

Was hired shortly after graduation by my current company. Began as an L1 SOC analyst for our at the time newly stood up managed service platform as an original member since day 1 - so I've seen it grow through all its ups and downs. Both my company and our client pool consist of numerous world-leading orgs in aerospace, financial, healthcare, etc. industries. In terms of exposure, have gotten to experience some pretty cool things in this regard. Time spent here was obviously pretty basic ticket work but I personally liked to dive into things to the best of my ability which stood out.

  
Quickly earned a promotion to L2 within the year, which I found to be ""the spot"", felt like I was doing meaningful (at least more than now) work, was getting deeper hands-on experience in client environments, tools, etc. and was being handed client requests and incidents for deeper work, much of which received accolades. Ticket work burnt me out too but a year or so later was given the bump to a lead role. This is where it began to stagnate. Rarely do I touch security work anymore and I suppose that's just the course of things. But, I want to do security...work now consists of all the behind-the-scenes BS that I'm sure many of us are familiar with, 20 meetings a day, upper mgmt starting and stopping new projects every week, senseless reviews and audits for busy work, tasks that should be ahem cough automated, it's just become a total slog. Been at this role now for roughly 7-8 months and realistically, the only way forward, is yet an even more management-heavy role which I do NOT want. Management is not something I desire to do in any way, I just know this about myself and have no interest in further moving into mgmt in any capacity. Which brings me to this consideration to change careers. 

""Look into incident response, threat hunt/intel, risk"" you might suggest. Sadly have, and unfortunately, at least within my current company, these are not viable. IR and Threat are either outsourcing(ed) to our India teams explicitly or have a hire-freeze in place. Additionally, they all route through each other in some capacity so without one it's basically impossible to move into another, thus starts the loop again of need job for experience can't get job without experience. Simply put, I was essentially told it's not going to happen, and do not have enough confidence that it will to wait around for it.

  
This brings me to \*why\* I'm staying: six figure remote work, four day work weeks, robust benefits, and including holidays about 8 weeks PTO/year. It feels borderline stupid to even consider leaving but at what point does burnout exceed the benefits?

Criminology interests me greatly and I've considered school again (though not my first choice ideally, at least not another four years) to pursue a criminology/forensics degree to tie into security. Had basic exposure to law and forensics tools and processes in college, nothing that I would list as meaningful for a job application, but I highly enjoyed what I experienced. However, I'm very unfamiliar with that move process without some form of LEO or law-aligned experience. A note: I can get vouchers for SANS and similar training through work assuming it fits my role, but seeking unrelated training will throw up some flags. Considered pursuing my GCIH via SANS, as that fits my current role but also outreaches into others. 

  
At the end of the day I truly love my team, and while I certainly don't hate my job, it has become very unfulfilling. Unfortunately feels as though my path either has me continuing at my company and moving into management which I do not want, or seeking work elsewhere, which I also do not want and therein lies the dilemma. Leaving current benefits is ultimately the deciding factor, or at least finding comparable.

Open to thoughts, open to considering further education, certs (while I don't hold these as highly as others) and training ideas are welcome. Would love to get more than ""just do hackthebox or set up a lab to tinker and see what you like"". If this would do better in the criminology sub I can move this there. Thank for greatly your time.

But, I want to do security...work now consists of all the behind-the-scenes BS that I'm sure many of us are familiar with, 20 meetings a day, upper mgmt starting and stopping new projects every week, senseless reviews and audits for busy work, tasks that should be ahem cough automated, it's just become a total slog. Been at this role now for roughly 7-8 months and realistically, the only way forward, is yet an even more management-heavy role which I do NOT want. Management is not something I desire to do in any way, I just know this about myself and have no interest in further moving into mgmt in any capacity. Which brings me to this consideration to change careers. 

""Look into incident response, threat hunt/intel, risk"" you might suggest. Sadly have, and unfortunately, at least within my current company, these are not viable. IR and Threat are either outsourcing(ed) to our India teams explicitly or have a hire-freeze in place. Additionally, they all route through each other in some capacity so without one it's basically impossible to move into another, thus starts the loop again of need job for experience can't get job without experience. Simply put, I was essentially told it's not going to happen, and do not have enough confidence that it will to wait around for it.

  
This brings me to \*why\* I'm staying: six figure remote work, four day work weeks, robust benefits, and including holidays about 8 weeks PTO/year. It feels borderline stupid to even consider leaving but at what point does burnout exceed the benefits?

Criminology interests me greatly and I've considered school again (though not my first choice ideally, at least not another four years) to pursue a criminology/forensics degree to tie into security. Had basic exposure to law and forensics tools and processes in college, nothing that I would list as meaningful for a job application, but I highly enjoyed what I experienced. However, I'm very unfamiliar with that move process without some form of LEO or law-aligned experience. A note: I can get vouchers for SANS and similar training through work assuming it fits my role, but seeking unrelated training will throw up some flags. Considered pursuing my GCIH via SANS, as that fits my current role but also outreaches into others. 

  
At the end of the day I truly love my team, and while I certainly don't hate my job, it has become very unfulfilling. Unfortunately feels as though my path either has me continuing at my company and moving into management which I do not want, or seeking work elsewhere, which I also do not want and therein lies the dilemma. Leaving current benefits is ultimately the deciding factor, or at least finding comparable.

Open to thoughts, open to considering further education, certs (while I don't hold these as highly as others) and training ideas are welcome. Would love to get more than ""just do hackthebox or set up a lab to tinker and see what you like"". If this would do better in the criminology sub I can move this there.

And not just amateurishly clicking around forums and doing a few boxes. I mean utterly pathologically and obsessively researching; building systems and networks, breaking into them, patching them, re-writing them; trying to cram as many years of experience as possible in as little time as possible. Over and over again, a never ending cycle of deep-dives and retracting back to the basics to make sure my foundations were solid, and back to more deep-dives.

Basic networking, linux/windows sysadmin skills (i.e package management, scripting, Infra-as-code, etc), ICS/SCADA, radio manipulation, embedded systems, automotive security, malware dev, Appsec, DevOps, DFIR, GRC, and so on. I'd pick a certification and read every study guide I could find online for it, knowing damn well I'd never be able to pay for it. I'd implement the concepts in a home lab to solidify everything I've learned.

And after a decade of learning, meanwhile applying for jobs and rewriting my resume over and over again... I've virtually gotten nowhere. I've worked for two different start-up companies that dissolved due to marketing failures, and the one established company i worked for (an MSP) had to let me go after a few months because they lost a big client. Ever since that one MSP let me go (which I'll re-iterate, was through no fault of my own), I've been stuck working in the food industry, factories and gas stations.

The worst part of it all, is that my obsession compelled me to at least try getting into the same buildings as the people who had the jobs that I wanted, which only led me to look through a proverbial glass ceiling, wishing I could be on top. An example is working at a food place on Fort Meade. I got to meet and talk to cybersecurity professionals all the time, if only in passing. For 2-3 minutes while they would wait for an order, I'd get to listen to them about what they do (albeit in a filtered way; clearances on the line and all). But at the end of the day, while I waited for the bus to go back home, all I could think is I would never get there. But I kept on pushing through anyways... for years even after that.

I worked at a gas station in Baltimore, where I also got to meet DB admins and SOC analysts as well... again, only in passing. Job after job, I'd find myself talking with highly skilled and intelligent professionals that I admire, only to feel a paradoxical rising resentment as time passed. I worked so fucking hard to be where they are, only to be the cashier that gave them their lunch and cigarettes.

As far as I know, no resume has ever gotten past an ATS and into a real person's inbox, and if it did, it was probably for a ghost job.

I'm just done, man. Pretty sure I'm just going to pivot to a career that plays to my other strengths like engineering, neuroscience or chemistry. Those student loans are gonna be real easy on my bank account. /s","Burnout rant

Using any comments received, I am planning to collaborate with others in neuroscience to conduct a quantitative study.

Pigeon hold at this job. ,"Just wondering what everyone's thoughts are on this?Currently working as Cyber Security Engineer where 70% of my time is spent rolling out patches. The rest of the time is doing some Vulnerability Management and some light scripting. 


Feels like I am missing out on a few things such as cloud tech ( we are on prem) and some other Security functions. 

Is it worth bailing on this job for something new?

Is that typical Cyber Secutity Engineer duties? 

I transitined from a Sysadmin to Security Engineer role a few years ago and ended where I at now. Feel stuck doing these patch cycles. 

Will say I feel paid fairly well and are full remote but have to believe there is more out there. ","Do you consider patch management a big part of Cyber security? Pigeon hold at this job.
