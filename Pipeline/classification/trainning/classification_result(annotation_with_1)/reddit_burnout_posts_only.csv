My goal is to stay in a technical role for the next 5-6 years (at least), leaning towards the blue team/engineering/architectural side (basically what I currently do). I plan to work full-time while obtaining either the Master's degree or certifications during my spare time, as experience > everything.

Additional info:

* Most likely leaving my current employer later this year, so their advice may not be as relevant (they don't really care about degrees or certs).
* Interested in roles at other US BigTech/FAANG companies.
* Cost is manageable for both options (\~20k for Master's, ? for certs); i.e., spending as little as possible isn't my highest priority. I'm not relying on my employer to pay for it.
* From what I have seen in job postings, Master's degrees aren't commonly listed as requirements for technical roles; certs occasionally are.

I'd appreciate your insights on whether another \~2 years for a Master's degree is worth it, considering tthe additional value they provide for the time I need to invest.   
If you recommend certifications, which ones would make the most sense? I'd consider OSCP, but I'm unsure about other certifications. CISSP is on the radar, but I have 2 years left before I can take it.

For context: I previously worked as a FICC trader and left to take a role in GRC because I needed a more stable position. My previous employer wasn't going to be able to keep me in that position for long, and I needed a stable income. I've been in my GRC position for over a year now. (Both of my roles have been at banks)

However, GRC is starting to feel like a dead end for me. I've been in charge of one of our audits, and the rest is basically internal assessments and dealing with vendors that do not send contracts for me to notify the regulator. I thought I just needed a paycheck and a 'slow-paced' environment (compared to a trading desk), and I would be good, but I'm starting to miss my old position a little too much.

The discussion I wanted to raise is, is it worth it to stay in GRC? Am I not seeing the bigger picture here? Because I miss having contact with clients, and right now, I'm only dealing with internal teams and the regulator. I have no regrets over what I’ve learned working in GRC (policies and regulations) but maybe it’s not the path for me.

Can someone who left GRC enlighten me a little? Or someone who stayed and had no regrets over it? I'm quite young, so I'm lacking guidance, and I’m trying to see the possibilities of what can I achieve staying in the area.","Is staying in GRC worth it?

I thought there would be loads of work, project assignments, etc waiting for when hired, but nope.  Made some recommendations but they went to the ether and never got a response on follow up. The CISO is a mess and have no idea what they are doing. We do not hear from them hardly at all.

I received some very nice thoughts, even some offers of work. But, after being insulted here and looking at my last job, I really don't think, IT or Cybersec are right for me. I have other options and I'm going to explore them.

Interest in a profession doesn't assure success. And my personality doesn't jive with a lot of the negativity. Honestly, I'm glad I'm retired, but I miss the fire department and blue collar work. It's a more supportive environment. Honestly, some of the DMs were pretty insulting. And I'm of a group of men that wouldn't take kindly to some of the crap ya'll say. Face it, you wouldn't say it if we were standing eye-to-eye. So, why here?

Lot of anger out there in the corporate world. Doesn't matter your politics, gender, sex, ethnicity. A lot of anger. And just don't want that in my life. I shared something and was probably wrong to do so. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, I hope you don't compromise your principles folks. It's not worth it. No amount of cash is worth that.

Don't get me wrong a lot of kind folks here. But this thread just edged the scales away from the vocation of cybersecurity.

By the way, I used the idiom 'brass tacks' accurately. Don't worry. You won't have any additional competition for these 'coveted roles' (as one DM put it).

And it got me thinking:  the older one gets, the harder it is to keep up with the evolving threat landscapes, regulatory changes, business operating environments, budget and staff cuts and many other things that really impact how a business manages their IT Security.  

For those who are young and starting out, maybe this is not a big deal and such persons are likely to be able to land on their feet should they take a fall.  Such persons are likely to pick up new skills faster and be more employable.

But for those who have been in the field in one way or another for like 20+ years are probably in their mid 40's/early 50's now - basically too old (and expensive) to get decent employment elsewhere, too young to qualify for retirement, and probably peaked career and salary-wise.  So if the burnout hits, it can hit hard and fast when you have likely have hit a brick wall but in denial.  

Also at this 45-55 age range, people have family commitments, significant financial obligations and cannot just head for the exit like that.  On the flip side if they are asked to leave from their current roles, they may not be able to sort out a plan B in a timely manner - so really a double whammy.

Furthermore, when I see yesterday's announcement of Palo Alto forecasting lower future earnings, despite heightend cyber risk (sending their stock prices lower by like 20% on the day), it further suggests that businesses everywhere are cutting their cyber-spend and taking on higher tolerances (sacrifices) on cyber risk.  This basically translates into budget/staff cuts, lower investments in tech and hiring freezes.  

So the wider industry is somewhat in pain.  And this pain may be felt by the more senior folks (they're senior, but too young to be boomers!) in this field than the young and upcomers.

So I wanted to start a discussion if there are persons here who think of leaving the field altogether and do something else?  Do you have an exit strategy in mind?  What would you leave a decent paying cyber role for? Would you perhaps use your experience to stay in cyber but work as a freelancer?

I recently left a senior cyber position at a multinational to start my own physical commodity trading firm (mainly agricultural staples, edible oils and such).  Totallly unrelated field and it makes less money, but I'm happier at least.  I've certainly learned more about how the world operates and got a better grasp on global geopolitics and macroeconomics through this than I ever have through all my years as a corporate drone at least!

I dont own any other Degree. 

Would my future career prospects be diminished? Or can i make as much money without a Degree when i just work With love and dedication? Feel free to share your experiences. Thanks!",is a degree important for my care er hey guys i am a junior pentester and work since   months at my company and i love this job. i also study computer science but i kinda hate it. i learned some things but nothing helped me at my job. everything helpful i learned was during work or on hackthebox and i feel i am wasting my time getting the degree because i could learn more by working more hours and getting certificates etc. would it be dumb to stop studying at the university i dont own any other degree. would my future career prospects be diminished or can i make as much money without a degree when i just work with love and dedication feel free to share your experiences. thanks,1,19,711,685,2024,2,Thursday,20,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1b3arw3/is_a_degree_important_for_my_care_er/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1b3arw3/is_a_degree_important_for_my_care_er/,1,0.7252138058601761,0.7252138058601761,SVM (Linear)

1b7sbkg,cybersecurity,K2Own3d,2024-03-06 05:56:36,1709704596,Quitting cybersecurity ,"I want to start this off with a preface:

I always did what society asked of me. I finished school with 2 degrees (aa in comp. Info. Systems. Bachelors in cyber security). I got a handful of major certs: sec+, cysa+, BTL1, CISSP, and CCNA to name a few. I have an IQ of 128. I have no diagnosed mental illnesses but I do suffer from major chronic pain that makes getting into an office pure hell.

I've been an analyst, auditor, grc architect, and currently am a L2 security engineer for a major corporation.

I've never felt in control no matter what I did. Every job I held I felt complete and utter burnout with the exception of the grc role which I actually loved and it was fully remote paying 140k (budget cut layoffs managed to ruin that which happens ALL THE TIME in tech). I feel like it's impossible in current day market to land another remote grc role again. I paid for premium linkedin and I apply until my fingers bleed every day. Dice. Zip recruiter. You name it. I'm using it.

With my current role I go home every day depressed and anxious and embarrassed that I just can't hack it (no pun intended). Working in infosec feels like an impossible game of tetris. The blocks just keep falling rapidly and you are just killing yourself trying to keep up.

I'm so tired...I'm in my 5th year of cyber security and I don't know how much longer I can hang on. I even told my boss idk what I'm doing or if this is even for me. I was hoping he would let me go right there but he didn't. 

I guess what I'm wondering is what should I consider if I'm done with cyber security? Has anyone here went on to do something that isn't so unfair and constantly demanding? I mean I am growing white hairs and have very dark thoughts that i wont get into but you can figure it out. I now take anti anxiety medication as well as pain killers just to get through the day. this engineering role is also on-site every single day which makes it even worse for my chronic pain. I feel defeated...

I feel like I'd be happier with a simple mindless job like being a bartender or a waiter...I feel like I should just be a janitor like Good Will Hunting...smart kid that just cleans toilets...just throw it all away because maybe then I'll finally be happy and content...I'll have a basic job that I can actually do well and when i go home I can enjoy some video games and relax like a normal nerd would...

Idk where I'm going with this but I just feel terrible and was hoping maybe someone might have something positive to tell me...maybe some advice or insight of some kind...am i the only one thats like this? Is something just wrong with me?

Anyways...thanks for reading and godspeed 🙏 ❤️ ","Quitting cybersecurity

I spent an entire therapy hour bitching about my job and management.","Edit - TY all for your responses. Obviously nothing “net new” in terms of have hobbies, hit the gym etc. Of course it all makes sense, and I 100% agree.

What gets me at my current job is that everybody, coworkers, mgmt, leadership, all of them talk up a storm about how important security is, and at the same time really don’t give a shit, as soon as they actually have to do something about it.

Idk- I think I need to switch to consulting or something. Then I could literally not give a shit about the outcome and get paid nicely.

Here, it’s like - I’m better off shutting my mouth and don’t rock the boat. But lord have mercy if something would happen that I would have known about and wouldn’t have pushed it.

Constant CYA mode and feeling like I have to pretend to care while nobody else does- I think that is what grinds me down the most.

Twofaced hypocritical BS.

Ty all.

Personal support in a different sense lol.

Decades ago, when I started out, I’ve heard that professionals in IT security burn out after about 10 years.  I’ve been in the field for 25 years. I think there needs to be different severity levels of burnout. 

If I could quit working altogether,  I would walk away, and never look back.

Sages, gurus and veterans of the field, how do you deal with the fact that nobody, including management, CISOs,  friends, coworkers, literally anybody in your life do not care about the job you do, as long as you don’t cause them any more work, as long as you don’t make them feel bad in any way, shape or form (unintentionally, just by nature of your profession), that you’re just a risk documenter, resource unit, warm body, a cog in the wheel of compliance, etc?

And don’t tell me that you like the pay (same), “it is what it is”, “nothing I can do”, etc. how do you actually manage to compartmentalize?

How do you keep away your frustration and disappointment from your significant others, families, etc.?

What hobbies do you have to help you cope?

I’ve picked up a number of them in the past few years, but I sometimes have a hard time even focusing on them, because sometimes my doubts in my purpose in this field are really strong, and distract me from being able to focus on other things. 

The fact that literally nobody cares whatsoever, I am mostly used to it, but sometimes it really gets to me.

Thanks.

Start with Root Cause: Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, and Greater Good say the top causes of burnout are:  
·       Perceived lack of control  
·       Lack of clear expectations of you or the role  
·       Heavy workloads/Unreasonable deadlines  
·       Poor relationships/Lack of support/Unfair treatment

The good news is it can be manageable if we (and our leaders) are open, alert, and supportive. The bad news is you need to do much of the work yourself.

And the constant need to up skill is a killer sometimes when you just want to work away for a while if life is super busy outside work. 

For context I got my degree in cybersecurity nearly 7 years ago. Since then I feel like it’s been nonstop and a bit of a pressure cooker since then. 

Granted maybe I need a new role with a different company that has more of a balance.

1br1cid,cybersecurity,Original_Tap1673,2024-03-29 22:25:51,1711751151,Clueless Leadership,"Throwaway Account, and yes some grammar is funny because I'm leaving out information on purpose. 

 

I know there is a stereotype of executive leadership (CISO/CXO) not being real security folks in larger companies that have dedicated C level Information Security representation, but I am curious what your thoughts are on my scenario and what people experience with smaller companies who may only have Director level responsible for security. 

First off my background, I got into Cyber before the recent boom (I was the first cohort at my Uni's CyberSecurity program), I between 5-10 years of Cyber experience in various positions(both Operations and GRC). I certainly know I have plenty left to learn, and by no means am I a ""business expert"" but I would say I confidently understand most of the business side of cyber. The current position I'm in, I work as a team lead for a team of 3 security engineers + 2 contractor who report to me. 

Now to discuss my situation, I report to a Manager who reports to the Director. My direct manager is fine, he's a seasoned veteran running a DFIR team, but he doesn't do a lot of business stuff and is not who I interact with most often. The Director has 0 technical security experience and worked mostly as a outsourced network support and physical compliance auditor until this current role. They acts as the CISO (self proclaimed title, yes it's in their email signature no that's not their official title). Unrelated, but why is that such a common thing? I have had 2 different bosses who both were not CISOs but called them self that and put that on LinkedIn. 

Given the Director has little to no security experience, I feel I do a lot of their security work. I perform all the security reviews/risk assessments, and approve things, they copy and paste my assessment into their reply emails. I draft 75% of their emails to the Board/Executive team, any technical questions I always draft for. All quarterly reports to the board/Executive team is crowdsourced by the greater team. I don't have any experience elsewhere, but I find the fact that they create 0% of the slides odd. Let alone the fact that because 20+ people are working on this, the presentation looks like shit, but they are also insistent on putting books worth of irrelevant text on the slides. I would think the Director would work to make their presentation and get the information from the team instead of them making the slides. Another item which I find annoyingly odd is that they insist the security team do nothing in relation to incidents, for example if we were to get notified of an info stealer malware on a server the only thing the security should do is create a bunch of paperwork to track it then notify the team they should remove it and request updates every so often. I don't have much experience designing IR plans, but in my opinion the Security team should be running the show and utilizing all of their tools to their maximum potential not just being a project manager in charge of getting update from people. One last tangent, like many companies we have restricted travel for Executives only, however, they have convinced the purse holders that they must travel to 6 different countries each quarter for compliance reasons. Not an expert in compliance, but given their trips randomly get canceled and never rescheduled I find it highly unlikely it's required for compliance. 

At face value it feels to me like they have very little security knowledge and are trying to get by as a CISO. The Board/Executive team had very little security exposure until recently and did not question anything they were told. I will mention that they absolutely deal with the budget, but I would imagine a CISO is much more than an excel file. I also understand there's a lot of politics that goes into running an department, so by no means am I saying they do nothing, but they're online maybe 1-2 hours a day.

I believe I have been pretty well compensated (USD 125k/year+15% yearly bonus in a low cost of living area with consistent \~10k raises every \~8 months. For reference this is at least 20k more than what my friends in my graduating class are currently making), but am I being compensated like this because I do a lot of my boss's job or just because Im good at my own? Is this normal in the CyberSecurity field? Should I search for a new job or look out to potentially get a career boost out of it? 

TLDR; My boss does not have security experience, I do most of their security related work, but Ive been promoted several times more than what I believe is usual. Am being promoted to help my boss?

The current position I'm in, I work as a team lead for a team of 3 security engineers + 2 contractor who report to me. 

Now to discuss my situation, I report to a Manager who reports to the Director. My direct manager is fine, he's a seasoned veteran running a DFIR team, but he doesn't do a lot of business stuff and is not who I interact with most often. The Director has 0 technical security experience and worked mostly as a outsourced network support and physical compliance auditor until this current role. They acts as the CISO (self proclaimed title, yes it's in their email signature no that's not their official title). Unrelated, but why is that such a common thing? I have had 2 different bosses who both were not CISOs but called them self that and put that on LinkedIn. 

Given the Director has little to no security experience, I feel I do a lot of their security work. I perform all the security reviews/risk assessments, and approve things, they copy and paste my assessment into their reply emails. I draft 75% of their emails to the Board/Executive team, any technical questions I always draft for. All quarterly reports to the board/Executive team is crowdsourced by the greater team. I don't have any experience elsewhere, but I find the fact that they create 0% of the slides odd. Let alone the fact that because 20+ people are working on this, the presentation looks like shit, but they are also insistent on putting books worth of irrelevant text on the slides. I would think the Director would work to make their presentation and get the information from the team instead of them making the slides. Another item which I find annoyingly odd is that they insist the security team do nothing in relation to incidents, for example if we were to get notified of an info stealer malware on a server the only thing the security should do is create a bunch of paperwork to track it then notify the team they should remove it and request updates every so often. I don't have much experience designing IR plans, but in my opinion the Security team should be running the show and utilizing all of their tools to their maximum potential not just being a project manager in charge of getting update from people. One last tangent, like many companies we have restricted travel for Executives only, however, they have convinced the purse holders that they must travel to 6 different countries each quarter for compliance reasons. Not an expert in compliance, but given their trips randomly get canceled and never rescheduled I find it highly unlikely it's required for compliance. 

At face value it feels to me like they have very little security knowledge and are trying to get by as a CISO. The Board/Executive team had very little security exposure until recently and did not question anything they were told. I will mention that they absolutely deal with the budget, but I would imagine a CISO is much more than an excel file. I also understand there's a lot of politics that goes into running an department, so by no means am I saying they do nothing, but they're online maybe 1-2 hours a day.

I believe I have been pretty well compensated (USD 125k/year+15% yearly bonus in a low cost of living area with consistent \~10k raises every \~8 months. For reference this is at least 20k more than what my friends in my graduating class are currently making), but am I being compensated like this because I do a lot of my boss's job or just because Im good at my own? Is this normal in the CyberSecurity field? Should I search for a new job or look out to potentially get a career boost out of it? 

TLDR; My boss does not have security experience, I do most of their security related work, but Ive been promoted several times more than what I believe is usual. Am being promoted to help my boss?

&#x200B;",clueless leadership throwaway account and yes some grammar is funny because i m leaving out information on purpose. i know there is a stereotype of executive leadership not being real security folks in larger companies that have dedicated c level information security representation but i am curious what your thoughts are on my scenario and what people experience with smaller companies who may only have director level responsible for security. first off my background i got into cyber before the recent boom i between      years of cyber experience in various positions. i certainly know i have plenty left to learn and by no means am i a business expert but i would say i confidently understand most of the business side of cyber. the current position i m in i work as a team lead for a team of   security engineers   contractor who report to me. now to discuss my situation i report to a manager who reports to the director. my direct manager is fine he s a seasoned veteran running a dfir team but he doesn t do a lot of business stuff and is not who i interact with most often. the director has   technical security experience and worked mostly as a outsourced network support and physical compliance auditor until this current role. they acts as the ciso . unrelated but why is that such a common thing i have had   different bosses who both were not cisos but called them self that and put that on linkedin. given the director has little to no security experience i feel i do a lot of their security work. i perform all the security reviews risk assessments and approve things they copy and paste my assessment into their reply emails. i draft    of their emails to the board executive team any technical questions i always draft for. all quarterly reports to the board executive team is crowdsourced by the greater team. i don t have any experience elsewhere but i find the fact that they create   of the slides odd. let alone the fact that because    people are working on this the presentation looks like shit but they are also insistent on putting books worth of irrelevant text on the slides. i would think the director would work to make their presentation and get the information from the team instead of them making the slides. another item which i find annoyingly odd is that they insist the security team do nothing in relation to incidents for example if we were to get notified of an info stealer malware on a server the only thing the security should do is create a bunch of paperwork to track it then notify the team they should remove it and request updates every so often. i don t have much experience designing ir plans but in my opinion the security team should be running the show and utilizing all of their tools to their maximum potential not just being a project manager in charge of getting update from people. one last tangent like many companies we have restricted travel for executives only however they have convinced the purse holders that they must travel to   different countries each quarter for compliance reasons. not an expert in compliance but given their trips randomly get canceled and never rescheduled i find it highly unlikely it s required for compliance. at face value it feels to me like they have very little security knowledge and are trying to get by as a ciso. the board executive team had very little security exposure until recently and did not question anything they were told. i will mention that they absolutely deal with the budget but i would imagine a ciso is much more than an excel file. i also understand there s a lot of politics that goes into running an department so by no means am i saying they do nothing but they re online maybe     hours a day. i believe i have been pretty well compensated but am i being compensated like this because i do a lot of my boss s job or just because im good at my own is this normal in the cybersecurity field should i search for a new job or look out to potentially get a career boost out of it tldr my boss does not have security experience i do most of their security related work but ive been promoted several times more than what i believe is usual. am being promoted to help my boss x   b,1,3,4663,4199,2024,3,Friday,22,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1br1cid/clueless_leadership/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1br1cid/clueless_leadership/,1,0.3231248847900129,0.6768751152099871,SVM (Linear)

I don't know what to say. I have worked in IT for 5 years. Ran the gambit from helpdesk to sys admin and finally landed a position as a cybersecurity analyst at a large company.

I'm bored out of my mind. Every day is a slog to get through. When I was a sys admin I had exciting projects that would require actual thought, and now I just feel like I'm back on help desk following the call routine. Sure there are moments where things get exciting and I feel like I have to actually think, but those are few and far between.

I'm going to be getting my computer science degree at the end of the year and am strongly considering dipping out once that happens and going to dev work.

So I suppose people can take this as a warning that cyber isn't nearly as sexy as it appears. Or maybe it just wasn't for me. 

I'm thinking of moving onto the dev world and keeping cyber as a hobby (you know doing ctfs and such cause that's fun). 

Any advise or words of wisdom would be great! Love yall.

tl;dr: Our C-level lives in the past, doesnt care for information security. Trying to do the job of the CISO while getting paid as an IT-assistant and getting blocked by the CIO in most ways. WTH is wrong? 

(Sorry for butchering the English language, I’m not a native English speaker) I’m currently trying to get the company I work for into information security (my role is more on the organizational side but I try to get into the technical side of it). You COULD call me kind of a CISO, except I’m not, my formal role is IT Assistant. Sounds plausible as I only have 2 yrs of experience. 

As of my understanding, if you do the isms part correctly (and bcms aswell), you get to know your risks in the Information security and can implement the right controls to mitigate them and thus having the real benefit of reduced risk of getting attacked an in case of an attack (bcms side of things) you should get the business back up quicker, because you did prepare yourself, know what to do and (mostly) have, what you need to get everything running again asap. 

I’m aware that there’s a big organizational part in it which is more “just compliance”, but it’s not just work for nothing except compliance. 

Yesterday I had a meeting with some consultants and our CIO (who got me hired in the first place because of NIS2). He told the consultants, that there’s no benefit in really going for the isms side of things and that we’ll do it as sloppy as possible to meet regulation needs but nothing more to get the money going “where it has a real benefit”. For context: Our C-level has no clue of IT in general and they couldn’t care less. The general attitude in the C-level is stuck in the 1990s, so are parts of the company. 

The way I got the message is kinda I have a bullshit job no one cares about in the company and they don’t want to do anything in this direction. 

I did not find the time to ask our CIO, what he really meant by saying this, but when I talk to him he seems like he wants to let me do my part, just not in the CISO position. That’s why I only report to him, he takes my work and chooses if and what to talk about with the C-Level, which is the least part of what I’m doing. 

I also wanted to get a further course to improve my skills. When I applied for the job they told me, that I could do that course in the first 6 months. Now we’re nearly a year in and the course is nowhere to be found. 

Frustration got to a level where I’m close to do the course out of my own pocket (around 4kEuro) and look for another job. 

Now for my question: is the CISO really seen as a bullshit-job (mostly EU, US is a bit more on the “lets try something new”-side of things), or is that a role that can have a real impact, if the c-level isnt that stubborn?
Maybe it’s less about the question and more about the rant, sorry. ","Uselessnes of NIS2 (EU)

Ive learned alot in the past 6 months and when I say alot i mean ALOT. Ive become very familiar with Azure and Investigating on there, in addition to Investigating and navigating FortiEDR, also managing Ransomware Cases and understanding how to deal in such cases (start ripping out wires and going mental) (that was a joke) in addition to conducting VAs and many more skills ofc under supervision of our TeamLeader where I asked alot of questions.

But idont know how to describe it, its like im getting overwhelmed, even when i take days off. okay i get my 2 days off to cool down but whenever i return its just hectic. there are few issues here and there but i feel like im getting drained, i cant simply quit and search for another job its so Hectic here and the pay is low. Ive tried applying abroad but every email is ""unfortunately"" and frankly nobody would visa sponsor a fresh grad with almost 1 year of experience abroad. I really love cybersecurity and I dont want to leave it but i just want a little break to relax work in an environment that is actually cyber not a mix of few things with a tad of cyber (i wish i could go into details regarding this but i cant and it hurts). is there something in cybersecurity where it isnt 24/7/365 and is also technical? or idk please give out your opinion id like to hear soemthing","Feeling Burnt Out

1cf92c3,cybersecurity,FutureDish3670,2024-04-28 15:30:10,1714318210,Worth it to transfer to a more prestigious school for a general CS degree?,"I’m looking for advice from hiring managers, people who’ve worked in HR or anyone who’s had experience transferring schools or degrees.

I’m currently in my third term at a small private university that has a dedicated cybersecurity track, and based off of what research I’ve done regarding important subject areas that are necessary to be successful in cyber (i.e. networking fundamentals, troubleshooting, routing and switching, firewalls, vpns, Linux etc.) the curriculum seems legit. Internships are offered at certain points as available courses, and a handful of the courses are set up basically as certification preps (CompTIA A+, Security +, AWS, etc.).

I have an opportunity to go to a higher rated school and was wondering if it’s worth it to put effort into trying to get in or stick it out where I’m currently attending. The college only offers a general CS undergrad degree. They have a Master’s program for cyber, but from what I understand Master’s really isn’t helpful or advisable until I’ve already established myself in a career. 

To be completely honest, I would like to be able to say that I graduated from such and such school (maybe a little conceited, I know), but if the people who hire don’t care all that much and the school that I’m currently attending gives me more applicable knowledge, then I don’t see the point in spending the time and effort.

Any advice helps, thanks.
I’m a little older, not typical college age.
Money for tuition is not a factor.","Worth it to transfer to a more prestigious school for a general CS degree?

“Hey, we’re totally fabricating our SME presence.”
“Hey, we’re totally lying to this client… and they’re making ME do it.”

I’m wrong, aren’t I?

1cjau8v,cybersecurity,Arminius001,2024-05-03 15:01:29,1714748489,Jobs being outsourced,"Hello everyone,

I work for a pretty large MSSP in SOC in the U.S. I'm closing in on almost 3 years here, a couple months ago I was promoted to senior security analyst. I noticed a trend starting early last year, the company starting doing layoffs at first for the tier 1 soc roles and helpdesk, not all of them but a good amount, then after a week or so we were introduced to new team members for the same roles that were laid off but they were based in India. Then in Sept of last year, layoffs again, this time tier 2 where I was at, at the time. Same thing a week later more teammates from India. Finally once I was promoted a couple months ago to a senior I thought I would be safe. 2 weeks ago, again layoffs announced, this time some of our security engineers and software engineers, you can see the cycle here, surprise, the following week those roles were replaced by people in India.  

Now almost 40% of my team is based out of India in the SOC, I know with our helpdesk the figure is higher, and with engineering its probably somewhere in the 20%. To be honest without disrespecting anyone, ever since the arrival of the employees from India, our quality of work has declined drastically, I am continually having to intervene on tickets worked by them, which is taking more time from myself having to work on high priority situations, we are constantly having miscommunication issues and it has made work much more difficult then it needs to be. Customers are filing more complaints then ever, some of our application projects for engineering that were due to be released months ago have been pushed for a further timeframe of 5 to 6 months. We had some of our biggest clients telling us that they will have to think carefully if they will want to renew their contract with us.

One of the main reasons I went into cybersecurity and spent so much time on education and certifications was because I was being told and led to believe this is a secure field for job risk. I understand a corporation's main goal is to generate profit. But I thought roles in this industry would be more inclined to not be outsourced due to the nature of security data that US companies would be inclined to not have that data accessible overseas.

So I can see the writing on the wall, either the company will start laying off the seniors and replacing us for cheaper labor or they will want us to stay here to oversee the environment. Doesn't matter to me though because I don't want to work at this company anymore due to the reasons I stated above.

Hello everyone,

I work for a pretty large MSSP in SOC in the U.S. I'm closing in on almost 3 years here, a couple months ago I was promoted to senior security analyst. I noticed a trend starting early last year, the company starting doing layoffs at first for the tier 1 soc roles and helpdesk, not all of them but a good amount, then after a week or so we were introduced to new team members for the same roles that were laid off but they were based in India. Then in Sept of last year, layoffs again, this time tier 2 where I was at, at the time. Same thing a week later more teammates from India. Finally once I was promoted a couple months ago to a senior I thought I would be safe. 2 weeks ago, again layoffs announced, this time some of our security engineers and software engineers, you can see the cycle here, surprise, the following week those roles were replaced by people in India.  

Now almost 40% of my team is based out of India in the SOC, I know with our helpdesk the figure is higher, and with engineering its probably somewhere in the 20%. To be honest without disrespecting anyone, ever since the arrival of the employees from India, our quality of work has declined drastically, I am continually having to intervene on tickets worked by them, which is taking more time from myself having to work on high priority situations, we are constantly having miscommunication issues and it has made work much more difficult then it needs to be. Customers are filing more complaints then ever, some of our application projects for engineering that were due to be released months ago have been pushed for a further timeframe of 5 to 6 months. We had some of our biggest clients telling us that they will have to think carefully if they will want to renew their contract with us.

One of the main reasons I went into cybersecurity and spent so much time on education and certifications was because I was being told and led to believe this is a secure field for job risk. I understand a corporation's main goal is to generate profit. But I thought roles in this industry would be more inclined to not be outsourced due to the nature of security data that US companies would be inclined to not have that data accessible overseas.

So I can see the writing on the wall, either the company will start laying off the seniors and replacing us for cheaper labor or they will want us to stay here to oversee the environment. Doesn't matter to me though because I don't want to work at this company anymore due to the reasons I stated above. I am continually seeing headlines of these tech layoffs but one of the main backings of these that isn't talked about enough in my opinion is outsourcing.

Bloat in software refers to the presence of unnecessary or excessive features and code. This can make the software large, slow, and more complex than needed, often reducing its efficiency and effectiveness.

**Why Bloat Is Still Software’s Biggest Vulnerability?**

**Increased Attack Surface:** Software bloat, with its unnecessary features and code, enlarges the attack surface for potential exploits. This complexity adds more entry points for hackers, making it harder to secure and monitor all vulnerabilities.

**Resource Inefficiency:** Bloated software demands more system resources, leading to inefficiency. It consumes excessive memory, CPU, and storage, affecting system performance and reliability, and often results in a slower, less responsive user experience.

**Complexity in Maintenance and Updates:** The more bloated a software is, the more challenging it becomes to maintain and update. Each additional feature or line of code adds potential for bugs and errors, making updates more cumbersome and error-prone.

**Reduced User Trust and Satisfaction:** Users often perceive bloated software as sluggish and unresponsive, leading to frustration and reduced trust. This negative user experience can decrease software popularity and affect the developer's reputation.","4 Reasons Why Software Bloat is a Cybersecurity Nightmare

I work at a small MSSP, 1 vCISO, 1 security architect, 1 engineer and 2 analysts that supports around 8 enterprises (in various sectors) with around 10k users total. All of the organizations use M365 (Office, Entra, Intune, Defender) and I am in charge and the main point of contact for all incidents and issues with any of our service (security related or not) and responsible for planning, deploying, updating, and supporting all configs and maintaining all documentation.

This includes Defender for Endpoint, cloud apps, Identity, Sentinel, Azure, Admin portal, Intune, Entra ID, Cisco Meraki, Cisco endpoint protection, Carbon Black, MDR portal, logic apps automation, conditional access, and others.

I also am in charge of our threat Analysts, assigning them responsibilities, creating and maintaining playbooks for them to follow, leading incident response, training them, and assisting with their day to day alert response (all alerts from the security tools are sent to our messaging tool for the analysts to review). On top of that I was tasked with redesigning and automating all analysts tasks and responsibilities with Sentinel.

Along with that I am the person anyone calls when there are any issues with anything even remotely related to any of the above and really struggling with no support from Microsoft support or vendors.

I was leading all meetings till I broke down and couldn't deal with the additional stress of architecting and pitching all of the above with the different enterprises IT admins and c suite, which can be very difficult when you are young and people do not respect your knowledge or opinion.

My company has a security architect that does not want to deal with Microsoft products, leaving all of that responsibility to me.

Am I crazy or is this an insane amount of workload for one person in a MSSP that is pushing all clients to full M365 for security? All enterprises are onboard with this but some admins and techs do not like Microsoft leading them to troubleshoot issues for 5 minutes before sending it to me.

My main issue is the lack of support from the top levels of my org and the enterprises we service making all the above even more difficult to track and maintain configs and issues across 8 enterprises by myself.","Security Engineer burnout

A lot of my free time is gradually getting eaten up by this job.

Things that are eating up my free time:

1.) Having to study for and earn Linux+ before the year is out. This is done after 5PM and on weekends.

2.) Having to earn a Splunk certificate before the year is out. This is also done after 5PM and on weekends.

3.) Becoming an expert on Application Security. In addition to working on the other two other requirements from my job listed above, I've been told I should be studying and absorbing information on AppSec. So, I've been doing that too - off hours, as requested.

4.) Return to office. I'm now losing at least an hour a week of personal time from the commute to the office. More days will be required soon too, from what I've been told as we're said the goal is to get everyone back in 5 days a week. 

5.) Getting late night calls when alerts go off.

6.) Getting more and more tasks assigned to me that can only be done after hours and on weekends (running scans, validating changes work, and so on).



I'm not 100% sure this is the career path for me if this is going to be the next 20 years of my life, and that's fine. I don't know if I should try to look for other cyber security jobs at other companies, or if this is par for the course in the field and I need to adjust my study plan to migrate into something else career wise.

  
Can you provide me with honest input? I'm okay with being told I'm not cut out for this line of work.

I've been in IT/Cyber for a good 8 years, I have a MS in cybersecurity and several certs some IT & some directly related to security. I was working 2 jobs last year one was Help desk/ Cloud admin and the other job was SOC. It was great I loved it but now those jobs are no longer here and it feels impossible to find any kind of IT job. I did get hired as an incident responder and I got all my stuff then the company ghosted me after sending me my welcome kit and my badge. 

Idk guys, it seems like with the spike in new people who want to work these jobs I can't be seen by an employer. I also feel like I have the experience, the skill, and the drive to keep working in this field. Ive been out for almost a year and a half and indeed and Linkedin are not giving me any results. 

I'm going to remake my resume one more time and see if that changes anything but if this continues I'm going to have to leave because I can't make money applying everyday and investing more and more money into training and certifications when there is no more returns coming from all of my time and money I've invested into this. 

If I do leave it won't be 100% I'll still play HTB/ THM and just dedicate myself to bug bounties check or no check but I can't make a living like this. Sucks that I'm going to have to go back to construction but at least I got to live the dream for a short time. I did meet up with other professionals to ask them for feedback on why I can't land another job and they told me "" They were shocked"" with my experience and skill sets that I'm not at least getting interviews. That did make me feel better because the never ending rejection does take a toll after awhile. Anyways imma change up this resume and land a couple more certs and if nothing changes I'll be going back to being an electrician.

My current company is pretty decent overall.

Problem is that I am either bored to tears on days with minimal work or I am working 60+ hour weeks with travel, onsite consulting, etc. and not much balance in between. It's affecting my personal happiness and relationships, I'm getting burnt out, and I don't like where this is headed. I'm starting to dread the daily mundane nature of my work that I once had such a genuine interest in. I still love parts of it, but man, it just doesn't have the flair it once did.

I've been spending a lot of time prowling LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, InfoSec Jobs, TrueUp, USAJobs, and countless random software / startup companies that I am attracted to hoping that one day I find my next stepping stone. I've had ONE phone interview between all of this, for an underpaid position, that turned out to be a flop. They literally told me that the position no longer exists and they don't have the budget for it.

Here is an AI summary of the book:

Cal Newport's ""Slow Productivity"" offers a new philosophy for achieving meaningful work without burnout, based on three key principles:

1. Do fewer things: Newport advocates for reducing commitments and obligations to focus on what truly matters. This approach allows for better results by enabling workers to concentrate on high-value tasks rather than simply being busy.
2. Work at a natural pace: Instead of constant urgency, Newport suggests giving important work the time it needs. This principle recognizes that humans are not wired for unceasing intensity, and that a more varied, natural pace leads to sustainable productivity in the long term. Strategies include making longer-term plans, doubling project timeline estimates, and introducing ""seasonality"" into work schedules.
3. Obsess over quality: Newport emphasizes the importance of producing high-quality work, even if it means missing short-term opportunities. This focus on quality both demands and enables a slower pace, leading to more meaningful career results over time.

The book argues that the modern approach to knowledge work, which often emphasizes constant activity and urgency, is unsustainable and ineffective. Instead, Newport proposes a more intentional and deliberate approach to work that aligns better with human nature and leads to more fulfilling and productive outcomes.""Slow Productivity"" challenges the culture of overwork and constant hustle, offering an alternative that aims to make work a source of meaning rather than overwhelm while still maintaining valuable output. By implementing these principles, Newport suggests that individuals can achieve better results, experience greater satisfaction in their work, and avoid burnout.","Have you read Slow Productivity by Cal Newport?

1ew5sne,cybersecurity,Fourply99,2024-08-19 16:11:23,1724083883,Is a Bachelor’s Degree worth pursuing given my background? ,"Hey everyone! I'm arriving at a bit of a crossroads in my career decisions. Put shortly - I want to specialize while reducing the customer-facing side of my job role. To cut to the chase - I'm looking for some guidance from some of you industry veterans on whether or not it's worth it to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity with my background or if it makes more sense to try diving right into some applications. 

Work experience-wise I have a little over 5 years of combined time in the IT industry: 

* I've been working for VMware (now Broadcom. Yes, it's rough here.) as a Technical Support Engineer for \~2 years and specialize in ESXi, VM, Certificate, Network, and vCenter management SME categories. 
* Before that I worked at an MSP for \~2.5 years and learned more than I could have ever hoped to in such a short period of time. My skill-set developed with desktop support, active directory, network stack (multiple vendors), MDM, Azure, Microsoft 365, Exchange Online, Google Workspace, VOIP system, account, endpoint, and network security policy, and other types of administration experience. In addition to this I also was put into the role of a Project Manager for some clients and towards the end of my time with this small MSP became the primary client-facing ""on-site"" technician for just about every major client we had. 
* My break into the IT industry was a temp/internship PoS support desk role at a retail corporation that was cut short at 6 months because I was laid off when March 2020 happened. While this role didn't exactly encompass much on the technical side, it helped me get to my position at the MSP above. I was still a full-time student when I took this job.

My formal education and certifications aren't anything to write home about in the slightest, but I do have an Associate's Degree in Computer Networking and Cyber Security from a Community College (the program was basically just a CCNA bootcamp. The 'security' side of it was practically non-existent). I also have/had a CompTia A+ (expired May of 2024) that I used strictly as leverage to get a raise at my MSP job as I was greener than grass at the time I was hired there and had not even completed schooling yet. It took me <1 mo to get both A+ tests prepped, booked, and passed. 

  
With all this in mind, here is the long form of the question - I have been working through [tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com) to see if the pentesting route is something I find interest in as I always had a desire to learn Linux, but never had the drive to do it. Learning how to hack into things gives me something 'cool' to do with Linux and has started me down the path to learning more than I did with creating BASH scripts for package installations on Apple MDM platforms. I find this stuff very interesting/fun and have throughout the years found it fun educating not only end-users, but also management/C-Level personnel how quick and easy it is to make a few changes to ensure simple attack vectors can be mitigated (and subsequently save money/data from the potential fallout). Especially when talking to the management teams at my MSP clients you would see these people light up with joy when you do something as easy as MFA on emails because they understand it significantly reduces the chance of an account breach. Security has always been fascinating to me. Seeing how 9/10 times when a breach occurs it's due to negligence leads me to want to pursue this as a career path from the broader background I have.

Is it even worth it to pursue a Bachelor's Degree given that I already have an Associates in Cybersecurity and 5+ years experience in the field? I know at the very least getting the Net+ and Sec+ for my resume are good first steps, but the monetary setback of a degree is daunting. Should I just jump into some job applications now, or am I too unqualified for some roles just yet? Specifically I am looking to first dip my toes in with a Security Analyst role. 

To avoid this dragging on further I'll end it here, but any input is greatly appreciated :)

1ff84y9,cybersecurity,HowAarya,2024-09-12 17:24:53,1726161893,I’m tired of applying for jobs (rant),"I’m so done. I’ve applied to 1000+ jobs in the last 10 months and I’ve only gotten rejections. At this point I’m just so tired and stressed and anxious and depressed. I lost my job last November and I have been looking for so long. Trying everything I can. Reaching out to people on linked. Applying for jobs everywhere, all over the country. Getting referrals. I’ve gotten 2 interviews the entire year! I don’t know what to do anymore. 

Some context about me and my situation. I moved to America a few years back to do my masters in cybersecurity. I started working for a small company a little more than 2 years back on student visa and I hated it. I absolutely hated the company. I even started doubting my competency because of how they made me feel. And while that was happening I was dealing with visa issues. I got laid off mid process because they didn’t want to handle my visa issues and I wasn’t even sure my OPT would get renewed. Thankfully in the end my OPT worked out but I had lost my job. Now if you know anything about foreign student working in the US you will know how restrictive and difficult it is. You have to get a job in the field of your major.

This year I applied for a work visa. I very luckily got picked in the H1B lottery. So now my application is being processed and if all goes well I will receive it in October. Now so far I’ve been stressed about not getting a job. It’s hard to find a company that will sponsor my visa and the worst part is plenty of jobs require clearance. Now I know there are tons that don’t. But it’s hard to find a company that sponsors me AND doesn’t require clearance. And even if I find all that I just get rejected. 

I’m starting to really believe something is wrong with me. Maybe my resume is not good enough. But everyone I ask to review gives me only minor adjustments but says it’s pretty good. I don’t know what the problem is. People around me tell me it’s not you it’s the market but how can that be the case for so long. If I at least get an interview I can show you myself. If I don’t know something, I will learn said something. If I know it I will show you everything I know. But to not even get a chance to speak to a human is so disheartening. I reach out to tons of people on LinkedIn but hardly anyone responds. Why is it so hard to just talk to people. To get one chance?

Sigh, I started therapy to help me regulate my stress and anxiety but that’s gonna take time. I have become extremely socially anxious and I don’t even go out. Every time I step out of the house or meet someone I have to spend money and that stresses me out even more. Every time I talk to people they ask me how my job search is going or what have I been up to. There is only so many times I can say it’s still going just as or nothing much. And everyone gives me suggestions of what I should or should not do. I’ve tried every thing everyone has told me. Nothing helps. And I know they mean well but that’s all everyone talks about with me. I don’t want to hear it anymore unless it actually helps me. Also I feel like, if I don’t apply for jobs that day, I am doing nothing productive and I get stressed out. But that stress is also making me not want to do anything. I’m in my late 20s. Life should not be stressing me out this hard. 

I know this is a long rant and is all over the place but it’s been long brewing. 

TLDR: I have been looking for a job for months and it’s been stressing me out. 

Edit 1: Thank you everyone for your kind words and thoughts. It feels good to know someone hears me and understands me and that I’m not alone in this situation. I did not expect so many responses but I really appreciate every one of you. 

Edit 2: Many of you mentioned it might be a problem with my resume or skills. I would love to get your opinions on my resume and how I could improve myself. https://imgur.com/a/7jxqfFb","I’m tired of applying for jobs (rant)
I’m so done. I’ve applied to 1000+ jobs in the last 10 months and I’ve only gotten rejections. At this point I’m just so tired and stressed and anxious and depressed. I lost my job last November and I have been looking for so long. Trying everything I can. Reaching out to people on linked. Applying for jobs everywhere, all over the country. Getting referrals. I’ve gotten 2 interviews the entire year! I don’t know what to do anymore. 

Some context about me and my situation. I moved to America a few years back to do my masters in cybersecurity. I started working for a small company a little more than 2 years back on student visa and I hated it. I absolutely hated the company. I even started doubting my competency because of how they made me feel. And while that was happening I was dealing with visa issues. I got laid off mid process because they didn’t want to handle my visa issues and I wasn’t even sure my OPT would get renewed. Thankfully in the end my OPT worked out but I had lost my job. Now if you know anything about foreign student working in the US you will know how restrictive and difficult it is. You have to get a job in the field of your major.

This year I applied for a work visa. I very luckily got picked in the H1B lottery. So now my application is being processed and if all goes well I will receive it in October. Now so far I’ve been stressed about not getting a job. It’s hard to find a company that will sponsor my visa and the worst part is plenty of jobs require clearance. Now I know there are tons that don’t. But it’s hard to find a company that sponsors me AND doesn’t require clearance. And even if I find all that I just get rejected. 

I’m starting to really believe something is wrong with me. Maybe my resume is not good enough. But everyone I ask to review gives me only minor adjustments but says it’s pretty good.

Quick background: Early 30s, graduated with a B.S. in Cybersec a few years ago. Final four semesters were also spent working as a student mentor for a government funded grant program given to my school to host a college-level credit offering ""cybersec intro"" course for high school students (only noting this as a CIA rep I spoke to said this is highly appealing to any govt-sector hiring process). 

Was hired shortly after graduation by my current company. Began as an L1 SOC analyst for our at the time newly stood up managed service platform as an original member since day 1 - so I've seen it grow through all its ups and downs. Both my company and our client pool consist of numerous world-leading orgs in aerospace, financial, healthcare, etc. industries. In terms of exposure, have gotten to experience some pretty cool things in this regard. Time spent here was obviously pretty basic ticket work but I personally liked to dive into things to the best of my ability which stood out.

  
Quickly earned a promotion to L2 within the year, which I found to be ""the spot"", felt like I was doing meaningful (at least more than now) work, was getting deeper hands-on experience in client environments, tools, etc. and was being handed client requests and incidents for deeper work, much of which received accolades. Ticket work burnt me out too but a year or so later was given the bump to a lead role. This is where it began to stagnate. Rarely do I touch security work anymore and I suppose that's just the course of things. But, I want to do security...work now consists of all the behind-the-scenes BS that I'm sure many of us are familiar with, 20 meetings a day, upper mgmt starting and stopping new projects every week, senseless reviews and audits for busy work, tasks that should be ahem cough automated, it's just become a total slog. Been at this role now for roughly 7-8 months and realistically, the only way forward, is yet an even more management-heavy role which I do NOT want. Management is not something I desire to do in any way, I just know this about myself and have no interest in further moving into mgmt in any capacity. Which brings me to this consideration to change careers. 

""Look into incident response, threat hunt/intel, risk"" you might suggest. Sadly have, and unfortunately, at least within my current company, these are not viable. IR and Threat are either outsourcing(ed) to our India teams explicitly or have a hire-freeze in place. Additionally, they all route through each other in some capacity so without one it's basically impossible to move into another, thus starts the loop again of need job for experience can't get job without experience. Simply put, I was essentially told it's not going to happen, and do not have enough confidence that it will to wait around for it.

  
This brings me to \*why\* I'm staying: six figure remote work, four day work weeks, robust benefits, and including holidays about 8 weeks PTO/year. It feels borderline stupid to even consider leaving but at what point does burnout exceed the benefits?

Criminology interests me greatly and I've considered school again (though not my first choice ideally, at least not another four years) to pursue a criminology/forensics degree to tie into security. Had basic exposure to law and forensics tools and processes in college, nothing that I would list as meaningful for a job application, but I highly enjoyed what I experienced. However, I'm very unfamiliar with that move process without some form of LEO or law-aligned experience. A note: I can get vouchers for SANS and similar training through work assuming it fits my role, but seeking unrelated training will throw up some flags. Considered pursuing my GCIH via SANS, as that fits my current role but also outreaches into others. 

  
At the end of the day I truly love my team, and while I certainly don't hate my job, it has become very unfulfilling. Unfortunately feels as though my path either has me continuing at my company and moving into management which I do not want, or seeking work elsewhere, which I also do not want and therein lies the dilemma. Leaving current benefits is ultimately the deciding factor, or at least finding comparable.

Open to thoughts, open to considering further education, certs (while I don't hold these as highly as others) and training ideas are welcome. Would love to get more than ""just do hackthebox or set up a lab to tinker and see what you like"". If this would do better in the criminology sub I can move this there. Thank for greatly your time.

1focakd,cybersecurity,miller131313,2024-09-24 13:19:02,1727183942,Burnout in cybersecurity ,"Hey all,

I've been working in cybersecurity for several years now, mainly across the energy sector in some very large enterprise environments. I have always been on the blue team side of things and have spent a considerable amount of time grinding at each employer; continuous learning through obtaining many certs, attending conferences, and striving to be a high performer in the workplace by taking on as much work as I could so I'd be recognized as somebody of importance and value to the org. I want to be someone people can trust and depend on to get things done. 

Through this, I found myself reaching the top of the pay scale as an individual contributor at my current org with a few years and transitioned into a cyber management role over a year ago. I was not necessarily prepared for this. I had no prior management experience and I did not really have a mentor, or a boss willing to share their knowledge with me.

Within the last 6 months I'm feeling so incredibly burned out. It's to the point where I don't care if I get fired/laid off. In fact, I long for it. All I think about is work, how much is one my plate and how much I can't stand it. Even when I am productive I get no enjoyment or fulfilment out of it. None of the projects interest me and it's so hard to push through. 

What are some things I can do to get myself out of this? I've taken time off to try and ""recharge"", yet I come back feeling worse and filled with existential dread. I'm very grateful for my career, but it is weighing very heavily on me. Any advice from those that have experienced this?","Burnout in cybersecurity

1fokmwn,cybersecurity,sloppyredditor,2024-09-24 19:10:58,1727205058,Regarding burnout: Understanding WHY is paramount,"(Posting by request.)  
  
Burnout and Impostor Syndrome will happen several times in a security career. While many ask about *how* to overcome it, the real question is *why* *does this happen?*

IMO, the main reason is we have very demotivational work in a misunderstood field. Our field is powered by negativity, justified with skepticism, and influenced by those who don't work with us on a daily basis.

We stop bad things from happening. An exciting day at work usually involves a crime, e.g., the organization we've been tasked with defending was attacked. A good day usually means our designs worked, but nobody noticed because they were able to do their jobs.

Breaches are happening everywhere and nobody seems to get punished effectively for it. In fact, *some get jobs* - by the very government asking us to defend better - *because of it*.

Tech is evolving faster than any other field, innovative companies are trying to adopt it a few months after initial release, and we need to be at least 3 months ahead of it, which means researching beta releases and conceiving the guardrails for something that may not even be a thing.

On a personal relations level, we're not a fun group to work with. People don't like dealing with password changes, MFA, firewall rules that block them from uploading files to customers, mandatory email encryption, etc. because we get in their way.

Audits ain't fun: It's not what you did, it's what you can prove you did. You have to back up every claim with documentation, logs, etc., that you typically don't think about unless you've failed an audit before. The auditors rarely know the ins and outs of how much effort it takes to meet compliance (regardless of what some will say, it is not easy) and they've got the ear of the BoD.

Finally, there's the cost. Breaches are expensive, so we're expensive. It's not difficult to see why the CFO scrutinizes our expenses when there's not any revenue coming in from the cyber folks. As messed up as it sounds in this forum, it makes financial sense to weigh ""how much would the ransom cost?"" vs. ""how much do these 4 technologies to mitigate ransomware risk cost?""

When we get out of our rhythm and look at our own situation it's easy to stare off and ask ""why do I bother doing this?"" ...and **that's** when the burnout starts.

**So how do we counteract the above? By remembering the reason we wanted to do this in the first place. FIND YOUR WHY** (supporting your family? being on the edge of tech? protecting people?)**, print it, and use it for motivation.**

And, for the love of all things holy, have a sense of humor about it. Laugh or you'll cry.

The Simpsons did exactly that in ""[And Maggie Makes Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Maggie_Makes_Three).""","Regarding burnout: Understanding WHY is paramount

When I was in school for Cyber Security, I thought I was really going to enjoy the work. I'm the guy that my in-law's reach out to with tech problems or asking if an email is legit or not, I'm the one who advises my family about staying safe online, etc. This has spawned from my role as the Information Security Awareness, Training, and Phishing manager at my company - I love the role, mostly. I use to like it more. 

I have worked for this company for going on 5 years now in the same position, more or less, and at two different branches in the company which were in two different countries. I've moved my family across the world for this company. A large reason for the move was to get away from a toxic CISO at my old branch. Now that I've moved to this other branch, my new CISO has begun to show their true colors and is arguably worse than my former CISO. 

Both CISO's have \*said\* that they care about the employee - ""Burnout is real"", ""Take breaks"", ""Take Vacation"". But they proceed to get mad at their employees for the dumbest crap (had a coworker get berated in front of guests at a presentation where he couldn't remember the acronym he was using and our CISO proceeded to chew him out in front of everyone). I once ran a phishing simulation which had some false positives. It was later found out that this was caused due to bad data from HR which included employees that had been terminated for years (some of them were even passed away) when the previous month's lists were fine, meaning a backend change happened at some point and changed my reports without me being told. My CISO proceeded to announce how I was making them look bad, along with the team. By ""look bad"", I mean that the CISO said I was making us look like ""Shit"" - this was in an email with me to our COO. 

That was all just my old CISO. My new CISO yells at me for things like using the moving service that my company paid for to assist me with moving to Germany. Evidently I'm only supposed to use them for urgent things - but getting my new born son registered with the German government isn't urgent? Or cost too much for a multi-billion dollar company? Most recently, I was yelled at because I informed my CISO during a one-on-one that my son might be a bit loud in the background since my wife was putting our daughter to sleep, meaning my son wasn't being attended to. My CISO understood this to mean that I was busy watching my son. She told me how I need to prioritize work and blah blah blah. I ended up becoming so frustrated with my CISO that I was basically yelling at them explaining why what they said was so offensive and wrong. My CISO also would treat a former colleague as if they were the dumbest person my CISO had ever met, even though the colleague has worked in Cyber / Technology since the late 90's. Basically forced the colleague to quit - which they did after handing in a doctor's note saying they needed a week off because of mental stress from our CISO. 

So, I guess my question is: Is the Cyber industry just toxic or am I just unlucky? What are some good, non-technology fields to pivot to? Will the military take a 32 year old veteran still? Cause I'd honestly rather deal with the military again than deal with another CISO. ","What is my real issue with Cyber?
I've been in the Cyber space for 4-5 years now and I've worked at two branches within the same company that whole time. When I was in school for Cyber Security, I thought I was really going to enjoy the work. I'm the guy that my in-law's reach out to with tech problems or asking if an email is legit or not, I'm the one who advises my family about staying safe online, etc. This has spawned from my role as the Information Security Awareness, Training, and Phishing manager at my company - I love the role, mostly. I use to like it more. 

I have worked for this company for going on 5 years now in the same position, more or less, and at two different branches in the company which were in two different countries. I've moved my family across the world for this company. A large reason for the move was to get away from a toxic CISO at my old branch. Now that I've moved to this other branch, my new CISO has begun to show their true colors and is arguably worse than my former CISO.

I’ve been working as a software developer for 3 years now, and after going through a tough consultancy job, I’m now at a good company where the work is pretty chill, and the salaries are decent. However, despite these advantages, I’m starting to feel increasingly bored. What frustrates me the most is the feeling that projects never end. No matter what I accomplish in a day, there’s always something left to do, and the next day, I have to pick up right where I left off. This creates a sense of “dread” because I know I’ll be facing the same issue tomorrow, and when I solve it, the cycle repeats. There’s never a day where I feel mentally clear and satisfied because everything’s wrapped up. That lack of closure makes the days feel endless.

On the flip side, there are good things too. The satisfaction of completing a project when everything goes well is an emotional high. But over time, even that doesn’t seem like enough for me anymore.

So I just took a federal job as an ISSM and I had a bad feeling since day one. Let me lay the situation out for you. My previous job was in the private sector at a large defense contractor where I was an ISSE. I loved my job and I loved the company, but with any private company you have its cons. My reason for leaving was simply because it was a federal job, which offered job security, better benefits, and ability to have a pension.

While all of those points are awesome, does it matter if you hate the job? I am a highly technical person and I enjoy being in the systems and working, which is what my last job was. This new one is a compliance role, which is just a bunch of paperwork and pushing policies on programs that I support. On day one my manager was complaining all day, saying how this work sucks, the people suck, and how she cant wait until she is done with it and or retires. The pay is comparable as they matched my pay so that isn't one of my concerns.

* Federal Job:
   * Pros:
      * Better benefits
      * Job Security
      * Ability to invest into a pension
      * Every other Friday off, and ability to telecommute 50%
   * Cons:
      * I hate the work, I don't feel like I would be proficient in it and I have no interest in it.
      * The people do not seem excited or motivated to be there
      * My manager told me she hopes I do good so I can help pick up the slack of others
      * Pay as you progress in your career isnt as good as in the private sector.
* Previous Job:
   * Pros:
      * I enjoyed the work and got every Friday off
      * The people were excited to be there and wanted to work
      * Fully Remote and can live anywhere in the US
      * Wasn't super stressful like I know the Federal job will be
   * Cons:
      * Potential layoffs/restructuring as you have with any private company
      * Health benefits aren't nearly as good, but they offer an amazing 401k and HSA program

I need advice because in my head, going back is the move. But I know I should give this new role some time for the new job blues to pass, but if I do that, my old position is gone within 2 weeks. I am at a loss and have never been this stressed over a job before, and I half feel stupid for feeling this way. Any advice is good advice here.","I am stressing over new ISSM role - Previously ISSE

I HATE being an intern. Don’t get me wrong, I’m beyond grateful to even have a position in today’s job market, but the title feels like a punch in the face considering the effort I’m putting in. I’ve worked hard, get regular praise from colleagues for my work, and they genuinely value what I bring to the team. But somehow, it feels like I'm playing the ""intern"" game wrong.

There’s not much expected of you as an intern. They say you’re mostly there to learn, but how can I stand around and just learn all day? Well, obviously no sane person in my field would do that. I didn’t just shadow. I took on tasks, tackled incident response, got brought into projects, and became skilled at so many different technologies.

After six months, I felt ready for a full-time position. I was balancing school, getting certifications, and putting in real work every day to drive and make change. Of course, this is not up to me to decide when I’ll get an offer.

My company acknowledged my interest in going full-time, yet gave me the “after you graduate” talk. Due to “legal” and “tax” reasons, they said I had to stay an intern until I finish my degree in May 2025. My only thought was - *are you serious?* But really? Shouldn’t I decide how much I can handle as a student?

  
I suspect there's more to the story -  probably about budgets, but the official explanation feels like another punch in the face.

Then there’s school. My experience on the job has taught me more about cybersecurity in 14 months than my degree has in almost four years. 

The irony is that many of my colleagues don’t even have degrees in cyber. They came from different fields, took a cert or two, and got the job. Yet here I am, balancing school, getting certifications, and building real work experience—only to be told I still need the piece of paper before I can move forward.

Anyone else been in this position? How do you view the “intern” title in a positive light? And what’s the right work ethic for an intern? For me, I keep feeling like I need to match full-timers. I feel I have so much value to provide, but providing that value as an intern doesn't feel right.

*And yes, I am applying to other places, and I will continue to do so...*

I mean utterly pathologically and obsessively researching; building systems and networks, breaking into them, patching them, re-writing them; trying to cram as many years of experience as possible in as little time as possible. Over and over again, a never ending cycle of deep-dives and retracting back to the basics to make sure my foundations were solid, and back to more deep-dives.

Basic networking, linux/windows sysadmin skills (i.e package management, scripting, Infra-as-code, etc), ICS/SCADA, radio manipulation, embedded systems, automotive security, malware dev, Appsec, DevOps, DFIR, GRC, and so on. I'd pick a certification and read every study guide I could find online for it, knowing damn well I'd never be able to pay for it. I'd implement the concepts in a home lab to solidify everything I've learned.

And after a decade of learning, meanwhile applying for jobs and rewriting my resume over and over again... I've virtually gotten nowhere. I've worked for two different start-up companies that dissolved due to marketing failures, and the one established company i worked for (an MSP) had to let me go after a few months because they lost a big client. Ever since that one MSP let me go (which I'll re-iterate, was through no fault of my own), I've been stuck working in the food industry, factories and gas stations.

The worst part of it all, is that my obsession compelled me to at least try getting into the same buildings as the people who had the jobs that I wanted, which only led me to look through a proverbial glass ceiling, wishing I could be on top. An example is working at a food place on Fort Meade. I got to meet and talk to cybersecurity professionals all the time, if only in passing. For 2-3 minutes while they would wait for an order, I'd get to listen to them about what they do (albeit in a filtered way; clearances on the line and all). But at the end of the day, while I waited for the bus to go back home, all I could think is I would never get there. But I kept on pushing through anyways... for years even after that.

I worked at a gas station in Baltimore, where I also got to meet DB admins and SOC analysts as well... again, only in passing. Job after job, I'd find myself talking with highly skilled and intelligent professionals that I admire, only to feel a paradoxical rising resentment as time passed. I worked so fucking hard to be where they are, only to be the cashier that gave them their lunch and cigarettes.

As far as I know, no resume has ever gotten past an ATS and into a real person's inbox, and if it did, it was probably for a ghost job.

I'm just done, man. Pretty sure I'm just going to pivot to a career that plays to my other strengths like engineering, neuroscience or chemistry. Those student loans are gonna be real easy on my bank account. /s","Burnout rant

Of course, I know this comes down to how the management thinks of security *(which I would say they like pretty much and help us in any way possible*), the mentality of the employees, and the industry, but cmon! Like, for real - do you happen to be chasing people all the damn time, constantly, to the point you are feeling like you are annoying them, but it is what it is and you gotta do your job? 

I tend to be quite helpful (*or at least nobody told me I am not*) when I discuss a security concern.

I am not the kinda guy who wants all vulnerabilities resolved. I have enough experience to understand that will never happen, nor do I want everything done in one day. I am a patient man, I know how to handle this.   
  
Employees of the company seem supportive as well, *kinda*.  The security department is a few months old and I am one of the first employees in the company I've been with the company before in the IT department so people know me. I don't want to hate the company or the position or anything, I am not a perfect person, but I am just wondering if I should switch to **DevSecOps** or **Application Security** *(I know they are different*). The thing that I like is technical work, not policies and similar GRC-related stuff. I don't do GRC now, the company uses it more for my technical knowledge and I like that.

There are a lot of meetings and lots of Excel reporting and Jira/Confluence stuff, which are not my favorite. Don't get me wrong, I like to write detailed comments, descriptions, and so on, but most of the time people don't seem to care that I try to help them with informative comments and guides.

Appreciate your lived experience!",need experienced opinions on how cybersecurity stressors are unique from other information technology job stressors. i am seeking to bring in my academic background of psychology and neuroscience into cybersecurity . in planning a research study i would like to get real lived experience comments on what do you think the demands that cause stress are unique to cybersecurity compared to other information technology jobs more importantly how do the roles differ. so please let me know your roles as well if okay. you can choose between   analyst and   administrator to keep it simple. one of the things i thought is false positives . url using any comments received i am planning to collaborate with others in neuroscience to conduct a quantitative study. appreciate your lived experience,15,38,1211,789,2024,12,Thursday,21,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hmy6vp/need_experienced_opinions_on_how_cybersecurity/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1hmy6vp/need_experienced_opinions_on_how_cybersecurity/,1,0.4039383060645535,0.5960616939354465,SVM (Linear)

Pigeon hold at this job. ,"Just wondering what everyone's thoughts are on this?Currently working as Cyber Security Engineer where 70% of my time is spent rolling out patches. The rest of the time is doing some Vulnerability Management and some light scripting. 


Feels like I am missing out on a few things such as cloud tech ( we are on prem) and some other Security functions. 

Is it worth bailing on this job for something new?

Is that typical Cyber Secutity Engineer duties? 

I transitined from a Sysadmin to Security Engineer role a few years ago and ended where I at now. Feel stuck doing these patch cycles. 

Will say I feel paid fairly well and are full remote but have to believe there is more out there. ","Do you consider patch management a big part of Cyber security? Pigeon hold at this job.

How in the world do you find time for research? I get so burned out from work, all while trying to balance my time so my long-term relationship doesn't fail because of me spending 16+ hours in front of a screen every day... And I also want to have time to hang out with my friends IRL. Do you sacrifice any of the above?

Does your work give you research time? 30+ days of PTO?

I am in my late 20s and already feel like I'm reaching my limit. Do I just take some breaks and then get back to the grind? I find myself needing more than 2 hours to read a 9 page whitepaper.
