I write this seeking advice from those that were in GRC and got into a more technical role (others are also more than welcome) because I fucking HATE the job/work. I provide mainly support, by researching norms and developing documents accordingly and that's it. I hate it. I can't wait for the weekend to arrive and I dread when the week arrives. I'm not learning anything new and feel stuck/stagnant. I WANT OUT!

For context, I'm a mid-thirties European guy with a non-technical degree that took a professional one-year course on cybersecurity. Learned the basics, alongside programing (pyhton and C++), linux and windows and got a job in the GRC department. Thought it would be a good stepping stone into the industry and, after a year, I regret it. I want something more challenging and dynamic.

I'm considering, possibly, a move into SOC or Forensics (I like the investigative side of security) and am brushing up on the basics by doing CS50 and studying for the CCNA to start getting a few certifications under my belt, in order to compensate for lacking a technical degree.

So, want do you think? Is there hope for me? 

Also, how did you get out and what steps did you take? Besides CCNA, what other certifications would be valuable in the long run and what other resources would you recommend?","Getting the f***k out of GRC!

I’m just feeling very demotivated right now and I’m just wondering what am I doing wrong? 

Some context: I just graduated with my BS in Cybersecurity from a mid tech school which has a decent reputation for our computing major. I have 2 internships that is 3 and 8 months both in Cyber/SecOps. I also acquired Security+ and recently CCNA. 

Some limitations: I’m an international student (crazy right? Cyber + not US Citizen not a good combo) so government and any positions that require clearance or to be an US person is a no go. Some people would assume that I need sponsorship but I actually don’t need to, so when I apply I usually say no, it’s complicated. 

I have been applying to all sort of position entry and associate level, Security Engineer, Network Engineer, SOC Analyst, NOC Analyst, Security Analyst, Help Desk, IT Support, etc,… probably 250+ application. Basically most IT related positions, I do shy away from PenTest jobs and GRC since I don’t have much to show for those and not really want to go into them. It just feels so hard to keep on searching and applying knowing that most if not all of the applications I do might just be worthless. Talked to the Career Advisor at my school, the only thing she told me to do was to do more networking but it’s so awkward, though I tried to do that too, doesn’t seem to have any effect on my job search neither. 

Most of the people in my major graduate and have a job line up even before they graduate, I’m happy for them but at the same time it makes me doubt myself a lot. Just feels like anyone that graduated can land a job and not me, maybe it’s just not for me? I know it’s hard to find a job in this market and December + January might be a bit slower in hiring and stuff but dang it feels bad.

Well, that is both the rant and the context. The actual question is: What am I doing wrong? How can I find an entry level IT job? 

Any feedback and tip is appreciated. If you would like to see my resume please DM me! If you have an entry level opening and looking for someone please also DM me or comment below!

I should be more grateful to have the role that I do. The people are nice, they let me work hybrid (mostly from home, few days in office here and there), and I feel more or less appreciated for the things I do.

On the other hand, it's hard to think of the last time I had a low-key day where I wasn't working on an active project and could catch up on learning. I guess there were one or two days here and there over the past 2-3 months. As I finish my ongoing project, I can see the next one(s) coming in the pipeline, and I feel dread.

I am fairly certain that other people are not working on anything, or at least are getting much more downtime, and this makes me feel bitter. Some projects are vastly different than others and require learning so many new things in short periods of time that I feel like I am lost and drowning. Some projects have many stalls caused by client issues, then they flip out and try to rush us through the actual work.

I can't easily leave because postings for similar roles ask for several years experience and certifications that I don't have. I don't even confident in my abilities anymore to actually apply and interview elsewhere.

I should be more grateful to have the role that I do. The people are nice, they let me work hybrid (mostly from home, few days in office here and there), and I feel more or less appreciated for the things I do.

On the other hand, it's hard to think of the last time I had a low-key day where I wasn't working on an active project and could catch up on learning. I guess there were one or two days here and there over the past 2-3 months. As I finish my ongoing project, I can see the next one(s) coming in the pipeline, and I feel dread.

I am fairly certain that other people are not working on anything, or at least are getting much more downtime, and this makes me feel bitter. Some projects are vastly different than others and require learning so many new things in short periods of time that I feel like I am lost and drowning. Some projects have many stalls caused by client issues, then they flip out and try to rush us through the actual work.

I can't easily leave because postings for similar roles ask for several years experience and certifications that I don't have. I don't even confident in my abilities anymore to actually apply and interview elsewhere.

198k1in,cybersecurity,finance-sister,2024-01-17 01:23:05,1705454585,Is staying in GRC worth it?,"Hi! I'm new to this community and I’m looking to open a little discussion here for some guidance. 

For context: I previously worked as a FICC trader and left to take a role in GRC because I needed a more stable position. My previous employer wasn't going to be able to keep me in that position for long, and I needed a stable income. I've been in my GRC position for over a year now. (Both of my roles have been at banks)

However, GRC is starting to feel like a dead end for me. I've been in charge of one of our audits, and the rest is basically internal assessments and dealing with vendors that do not send contracts for me to notify the regulator. I thought I just needed a paycheck and a 'slow-paced' environment (compared to a trading desk), and I would be good, but I'm starting to miss my old position a little too much.

The discussion I wanted to raise is, is it worth it to stay in GRC? Am I not seeing the bigger picture here? Because I miss having contact with clients, and right now, I'm only dealing with internal teams and the regulator. I have no regrets over what I’ve learned working in GRC (policies and regulations) but maybe it’s not the path for me.

Can someone who left GRC enlighten me a little? Or someone who stayed and had no regrets over it? I'm quite young, so I'm lacking guidance, and I’m trying to see the possibilities of what can I achieve staying in the area.","Is staying in GRC worth it?

This is not a humble brag, I just really want to know if anyone has been here before.

1afg1g4,cybersecurity,GreenNine,2024-01-31 11:47:02,1706701622,SOC Analyst vs. IT Auditor for future career in vulnerability management.,"Hi everyone!

I have nearly two years of experience as a Tier 1 Engineer at an ISP (basic network support/help desk). Over the last year I've been studying and had several hands-on courses in networking, Windows and Linux system administration. I'm close to finishing the course for the eEDA certification from INE Security (formely eLearnSecurity).

My goal is to eventually work in vulnerability management (I am aware that I need a few years of experience + knowledge of different systems, networks, web apps + certifications) so I wanted to ask for your opinion on whether experience as a SOC analyst or IT auditor would be more suitable for the role (as these two are what I'm aiming for).

In the city I live, there are occasional openings for a Junior IT Auditor, as well as SOC Analysts.

I could apply for the auditor role after I've (hopefully) passed the eEDA, or I could continue with my other plan to finish several courses I have planned + the BTL1 and apply for a SOC role.

If working at a SOC did not include a rotation between day/nigh shifts, this would be a no-brainer, but I've no idea how this would impact my health. Lots of people say this is absolutely brutal, others aren't phased at all and actually love the schedule (2 days, 2 nights, 4 days). Burnout and alarm fatigue is also part of the picture, as I've read, but that I could live with. Not my first rodeo in that department.

TL;DR: For someone who wants to eventually work in Vulnerability Management, which of the two roles be a better fit: IT Auditor or SOC Analyst?  


PS: I've researched both roles quite a bit and the auditor one seems a lot less technical (at least the entry level one I'm looking at), but you seem to get some exposure to different systems/set ups, whereas in a SOC you can just be looking at alarms all day, or have many different duties, and everything in between. Out of all positions I've researched (e.g. security engineering, threat hunting, DFIR, pentesting, GRC, threat intel, etc.), vulnerability management is the one I'm most drawn to.","SOC Analyst vs. IT Auditor for future career in vulnerability management.

TL;DR: For someone who wants to eventually work in Vulnerability Management, which of the two roles be a better fit: IT Auditor or SOC Analyst?  


PS: I've researched both roles quite a bit and the auditor one seems a lot less technical (at least the entry level one I'm looking at), but you seem to get some exposure to different systems/set ups, whereas in a SOC you can just be looking at alarms all day, or have many different duties, and everything in between.

Right now I am basically a GRC analyst working for a state government. My duties are mainly around creating SSPs for systems and getting ATOs. I’ve been doing this for almost two years. While the work is sometimes interesting, it’s mostly bureaucratic paper pushing and not really the side of cybersecurity I enjoy. 

I also was the first GRC analyst on the team (I had no prior experience except for a few months in the SOC - more on that in a minute), so I don’t really have very much guidance and basically have to figure everything out myself. This is good and bad, but I’ve reached a point where I would appreciate some mentorship in cyber skills rather than just doing it all alone. 

I have a desire to get back into the SOC as I enjoy the technical side of cyber much more than the policy/controls side. I nope’d out of a truly toxic SOC for my current job (left because of the management, not due to the type of work) and looking back I did like the blue team role quite a bit.

I’ve got 2.5 years of Cyber experience and my Sec+, getting ready to take the CySa+/Pentest+ in a month or so. 

Anyone else have experience going from GRC to the SOC? Is it worth it? Am I crazy for trying to go back to the SOC? Are there other options I should consider first?

I am removing the post for professional and personal reasons. I do appreciate the replies, offers, and posts. After careful consideration and after reading several snide and rude comments, I've decided I'm just going to venture out into a different endeavor.

I received some very nice thoughts, even some offers of work. But, after being insulted here and looking at my last job, I really don't think, IT or Cybersec are right for me. I have other options and I'm going to explore them.

Interest in a profession doesn't assure success. And my personality doesn't jive with a lot of the negativity. Honestly, I'm glad I'm retired, but I miss the fire department and blue collar work. It's a more supportive environment. Honestly, some of the DMs were pretty insulting. And I'm of a group of men that wouldn't take kindly to some of the crap ya'll say. Face it, you wouldn't say it if we were standing eye-to-eye. So, why here?

Lot of anger out there in the corporate world. Doesn't matter your politics, gender, sex, ethnicity. A lot of anger. And just don't want that in my life. I shared something and was probably wrong to do so. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, I hope you don't compromise your principles folks. It's not worth it. No amount of cash is worth that.

Don't get me wrong a lot of kind folks here. But this thread just edged the scales away from the vocation of cybersecurity.

TLDR: Folks who leveled a volley of insults-GFY. The polite kind folks, thanks. ***In short, I'd rather turn tricks in a truck stop parking lot than work with some of you***. By the way, I used the idiom 'brass tacks' accurately. Don't worry. You won't have any additional competition for these 'coveted roles' (as one DM put it). Personally, I hope some of you a-holes find yourselves where you belong. Good day, folks. ","Fired a couple of months ago. Found out why and I'm very PO'd!

And it got me thinking:  the older one gets, the harder it is to keep up with the evolving threat landscapes, regulatory changes, business operating environments, budget and staff cuts and many other things that really impact how a business manages their IT Security.  

For those who are young and starting out, maybe this is not a big deal and such persons are likely to be able to land on their feet should they take a fall.  Such persons are likely to pick up new skills faster and be more employable.

But for those who have been in the field in one way or another for like 20+ years are probably in their mid 40's/early 50's now - basically too old (and expensive) to get decent employment elsewhere, too young to qualify for retirement, and probably peaked career and salary-wise.  So if the burnout hits, it can hit hard and fast when you have likely have hit a brick wall but in denial.  

Also at this 45-55 age range, people have family commitments, significant financial obligations and cannot just head for the exit like that.  On the flip side if they are asked to leave from their current roles, they may not be able to sort out a plan B in a timely manner - so really a double whammy.

Furthermore, when I see yesterday's announcement of Palo Alto forecasting lower future earnings, despite heightend cyber risk (sending their stock prices lower by like 20% on the day), it further suggests that businesses everywhere are cutting their cyber-spend and taking on higher tolerances (sacrifices) on cyber risk.  This basically translates into budget/staff cuts, lower investments in tech and hiring freezes.  

So the wider industry is somewhat in pain.  And this pain may be felt by the more senior folks (they're senior, but too young to be boomers!) in this field than the young and upcomers.

So I wanted to start a discussion if there are persons here who think of leaving the field altogether and do something else?  Do you have an exit strategy in mind?  What would you leave a decent paying cyber role for? Would you perhaps use your experience to stay in cyber but work as a freelancer?

I recently left a senior cyber position at a multinational to start my own physical commodity trading firm (mainly agricultural staples, edible oils and such).  Totallly unrelated field and it makes less money, but I'm happier at least.  I've certainly learned more about how the world operates and got a better grasp on global geopolitics and macroeconomics through this than I ever have through all my years as a corporate drone at least!

Everything helpful i learned Was during work or on HackTheBox and i feel i am wasting my time getting the Degree, because i could learn more by working more hours and getting Certificates etc. Would it be dumb to stop studying at the University? I dont own any other Degree. 

Would my future career prospects be diminished? Or can i make as much money without a Degree when i just work With love and dedication? Feel free to share your experiences. Thanks!",is a degree important for my care er hey guys i am a junior pentester and work since   months at my company and i love this job. i also study computer science but i kinda hate it. i learned some things but nothing helped me at my job. everything helpful i learned was during work or on hackthebox and i feel i am wasting my time getting the degree because i could learn more by working more hours and getting certificates etc. would it be dumb to stop studying at the university i dont own any other degree. would my future career prospects be diminished or can i make as much money without a degree when i just work with love and dedication feel free to share your experiences. thanks,1,19,711,685,2024,2,Thursday,20,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1b3arw3/is_a_degree_important_for_my_care_er/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1b3arw3/is_a_degree_important_for_my_care_er/,1,0.7832036382748679,0.7832036382748679,SVM (Linear)
1b7sbkg,cybersecurity,K2Own3d,2024-03-06 05:56:36,1709704596,Quitting cybersecurity ,"I want to start this off with a preface:

I always did what society asked of me. I finished school with 2 degrees (aa in comp. Info. Systems. Bachelors in cyber security). I got a handful of major certs: sec+, cysa+, BTL1, CISSP, and CCNA to name a few. I have an IQ of 128. I have no diagnosed mental illnesses but I do suffer from major chronic pain that makes getting into an office pure hell.

I've been an analyst, auditor, grc architect, and currently am a L2 security engineer for a major corporation.

I've never felt in control no matter what I did. Every job I held I felt complete and utter burnout with the exception of the grc role which I actually loved and it was fully remote paying 140k (budget cut layoffs managed to ruin that which happens ALL THE TIME in tech). I feel like it's impossible in current day market to land another remote grc role again. I paid for premium linkedin and I apply until my fingers bleed every day. Dice. Zip recruiter. You name it. I'm using it.

With my current role I go home every day depressed and anxious and embarrassed that I just can't hack it (no pun intended). Working in infosec feels like an impossible game of tetris. The blocks just keep falling rapidly and you are just killing yourself trying to keep up.

I'm so tired...I'm in my 5th year of cyber security and I don't know how much longer I can hang on. I even told my boss idk what I'm doing or if this is even for me. I was hoping he would let me go right there but he didn't. 

I guess what I'm wondering is what should I consider if I'm done with cyber security? Has anyone here went on to do something that isn't so unfair and constantly demanding? I mean I am growing white hairs and have very dark thoughts that i wont get into but you can figure it out. I now take anti anxiety medication as well as pain killers just to get through the day. this engineering role is also on-site every single day which makes it even worse for my chronic pain. I feel defeated...

I feel like I'd be happier with a simple mindless job like being a bartender or a waiter...I feel like I should just be a janitor like Good Will Hunting...smart kid that just cleans toilets...just throw it all away because maybe then I'll finally be happy and content...I'll have a basic job that I can actually do well and when i go home I can enjoy some video games and relax like a normal nerd would...

Idk where I'm going with this but I just feel terrible and was hoping maybe someone might have something positive to tell me...maybe some advice or insight of some kind...am i the only one thats like this? Is something just wrong with me?

Anyways...thanks for reading and godspeed 🙏 ❤️ ","Quitting cybersecurity

I spent an entire therapy hour bitching about my job and management.","Edit - TY all for your responses. Obviously nothing “net new” in terms of have hobbies, hit the gym etc. Of course it all makes sense, and I 100% agree.

What gets me at my current job is that everybody, coworkers, mgmt, leadership, all of them talk up a storm about how important security is, and at the same time really don’t give a shit, as soon as they actually have to do something about it.

Idk- I think I need to switch to consulting or something. Then I could literally not give a shit about the outcome and get paid nicely.

Here, it’s like - I’m better off shutting my mouth and don’t rock the boat. But lord have mercy if something would happen that I would have known about and wouldn’t have pushed it.

Constant CYA mode and feeling like I have to pretend to care while nobody else does- I think that is what grinds me down the most.

Twofaced hypocritical BS.

Ty all.

Personal support in a different sense lol.

Decades ago, when I started out, I’ve heard that professionals in IT security burn out after about 10 years.  I’ve been in the field for 25 years. I think there needs to be different severity levels of burnout. 

If I could quit working altogether,  I would walk away, and never look back.

Sages, gurus and veterans of the field, how do you deal with the fact that nobody, including management, CISOs,  friends, coworkers, literally anybody in your life do not care about the job you do, as long as you don’t cause them any more work, as long as you don’t make them feel bad in any way, shape or form (unintentionally, just by nature of your profession), that you’re just a risk documenter, resource unit, warm body, a cog in the wheel of compliance, etc?

And don’t tell me that you like the pay (same), “it is what it is”, “nothing I can do”, etc. how do you actually manage to compartmentalize?

How do you keep away your frustration and disappointment from your significant others, families, etc.?

What hobbies do you have to help you cope?

I’ve picked up a number of them in the past few years, but I sometimes have a hard time even focusing on them, because sometimes my doubts in my purpose in this field are really strong, and distract me from being able to focus on other things. 

The fact that literally nobody cares whatsoever, I am mostly used to it, but sometimes it really gets to me.

Thanks.

1b95umf,cybersecurity,TheCyberIntellect,2024-03-07 21:24:09,1709846649,Need your guys advice….,"I find myself in a bit of a career dilemma and could use some advice. I've been working as a SOC Tier 1 Analyst since Sept 2023, and my plan was to start a master's program in Sept 2024, which would take two years to complete. Additionally, I wanted a promotion to Tier 2 Analyst on the short termZ

However i recently had a discussion with my manager about pursuing my master's and seeking a promotion to Tier 2. However, the situation isn't as straightforward as I hoped.

As with many SOC analysts, my schedule involves 24/7 shifts, which is gonna make it challenging to find the right time for the master's program. The company won't cover the cost of the master's since my manager considers it not directly related to the SOC. It is a cybersecurity master tho, focusing on concepts such as incident response, risk management, malware analysis, and network security. My manager emphasizes focusing on courses related to our tooling, which I understand, but feel like he has a bit biased towards masters.

When I asked about my goal to promote to Tier 2, I was told it's too early to discuss. He acknowledged my performance but remained vague about the timeline. I suspect it might take at least a year, which seems like a stretch as my Tier 1 job is becoming easier, and I'm unsure how long I can sustain it. Luckily, there's a thin line between Tier 1 and Tier 2, as we can also improve rules, go hunting, etc., but I wanted Tier 2 for its 9-5 schedule, which would also benefit my master's with a more ""normal"" schedule.

Feeling a bit disappointed and unsure of my next steps, I would appreciate any insights or advice you all might have. How should I navigate this situation? Has anyone faced a similar scenario, and if so, what decisions did you make? Looking forward to your thoughts and experiences. Thanks!","Need your guys advice….

My issue with burnout articles is they tend to offer vague suggestions and end with a sales pitch. Honestly the key is in the Serenity Prayer: accept the things you cannot change, be brave enough to change what you can, and be wise enough to know the difference.

Start with Root Cause: Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, and Greater Good say the top causes of burnout are:  
·       Perceived lack of control  
·       Lack of clear expectations of you or the role  
·       Heavy workloads/Unreasonable deadlines  
·       Poor relationships/Lack of support/Unfair treatment  
·       Problems with work-life balance  
  
I will add ""A persistent stream of negativity"" to the pile.  
  
The good news is it can be manageable if we (and our leaders) are open, alert, and supportive. The bad news is you need to do much of the work yourself. 

Retention is vital, and this is an opportunity to improve engagement, perception, and overall health. Please join me in putting actionable advice in the comments.","Discussion thread: Actionable advice to mitigate burnout

I don't know what to say. I have worked in IT for 5 years. Ran the gambit from helpdesk to sys admin and finally landed a position as a cybersecurity analyst at a large company.

I'm bored out of my mind. Every day is a slog to get through. When I was a sys admin I had exciting projects that would require actual thought, and now I just feel like I'm back on help desk following the call routine. Sure there are moments where things get exciting and I feel like I have to actually think, but those are few and far between.

I'm going to be getting my computer science degree at the end of the year and am strongly considering dipping out once that happens and going to dev work.

So I suppose people can take this as a warning that cyber isn't nearly as sexy as it appears. Or maybe it just wasn't for me. 

I'm thinking of moving onto the dev world and keeping cyber as a hobby (you know doing ctfs and such cause that's fun). 

Any advise or words of wisdom would be great! Love yall.

I presently work in finance, advising projects when developing new applications (or changes to existing) on best practice, standards, how or what they should be doing etc. Previously I’ve worked in GRC, been a IT Manager and IT Support grunt across finance, retail and OT.

I wouldn’t say my current role is full blown Security Architect. The role is very hands off with technology, and mostly advising and drafting standards, patterns a guidelines (e.g. API design) but having to quickly digest technology and solution designs. It’s pretty dull tbh.

While the job is hands off, I do spend some time learning and trying things that are hands on, for example at the moment that includes cloud services from a particular vendor, learning to use GitHub actions, terraform, testing etc. Got a wee side project trying to create a Serverless CA solution using something open source, possibly going to use Step-CA (might be too much for one person but let’s see).

Part of me wants to take a step back into a job that is much more hands on again, but then the stuff I currently do (in work and personal time) makes me think I’m closer to a Solution Architect than something specifically Security. My current mode feels very adrift and aimless since the job market is rubbish. I’m just trying to feather my bows in readiness for something that comes along when hopefully the market improves.

Reading this hopefully isn’t too vague. But if anyone reading this had any thoughts or suggestions, insights or experiences?

Joined as an L1 SOC analyst almost a year back and the work is very unsatisfying personally. The only thing I do is check alerts from XDR/EDR tools, Mark a verdict and send a 5-10 sentence report as the 'analysis'. There is no other work for me, i do not configure anything, don't work on SIEM, nothing. I'm good at what i do and that's because the job is too easy at this point. 

I have no prior work experience so this is my first job and even then i don't feel like i am being challenged at all. I did my MSC in information Security, and truth be told i feel my course focused on GRC more other practical knowledge (had a bit of that too though). 

However,  not sure I'll enjoy the work or the pay working in GRC and though i know a bit, the intermediate levels of coding (Python), i am not sure if i can excel at DevSecOps or pentesting as these domains needs a much deeper understanding than what i have right now. I could learn but it'd take ages to be ""good"" at it. 

I also hate being a soc since the shifts keeps changing and my body just doesn't like the fact that it has to adapt every few weeks. Finding a SOC role which pays well, and doesn't have night shift is really difficult given those jobs are a rarity here in India.


Feels like I've hit a brick wall. I'm working on gaining knowledge, certifications and stuff but working my way up from scratch without a clear idea of what to do is a bit difficult. Also, finding a good job without work experience is a pain I'm sure everyone knows.

I need major help in determining how to go forth from here in terms of career. I historically was of the software engineering hobby-type and tinkerer and then started working in a SOC after graduating with a bachelors degree in computer science. It was during covid and that was the job I could get -- and was thankful to have. 

I'm completely burned out on Alerts, ATOs, and vulnerabilities and am looking for a new job after about 4 years experience total. This market is of course... a bit rough -- and I hate doing SOC work. I'd rather be typing code and working with cloud appsec/prodsec etc and being technical specialist hands on. I also am not historically of the IT type where I started as a Sysadmin, Network firewall admin, etc. 

Had an interview today for an architect position. The hiring manager said the following which was kind of interesting to hear -- and in my opinion a bit of a red flag:

**Potential Minuses**

* I’d be expected to be team lead and do some managerial duties down the line. The exact balance between being individual contributor and team lead would vary per my interviewer's wording, depending on how he views the new staff member's strengths. If he thinks someone is stronger individual contributor, they'll manage less
* People would come to me with questions and seeking advice, especially the contractors **\[this position is to be the only FTE on the team -- and to become the manager's right-hand man\]**
* Less playing hands on with technical toys and skills, more about consulting on projects to identify risks in architecture and addressing it accordingly
* SANS training opportunity attendance is relatively fewer. He mentioned how hard it was to get it for employees due to price ($8,000 per training... apparently they don't get a discount on class purchases). That's interesting to hear, but I could do some cloud certs out of my own pocket
* 4x360 reviews, four people review you for promo and annual review. So one needs to be very strong and collaborative both with people within and outside the security architecture team, where four people give you a performance feedback for yearly review
* Harder to retain technical skills and capabilities in this role. Architecture is just a bit abstract. So in this role technical skills can completely atrophy.... I historically have been more technically hands on

**Pluses of this role:**

* Larger company in financial services. potential to move around internally if I need something better \[i guess, didn't confirm this with hiring manager\]
* It's potentially the job I can get in this market. Have been hunting since August 2023 for a new gig
* Leaving a poorly run SOC and lack of technical, career, and fiscal growth. I do not want to see another alert in my life
* Potentially some appsec component to it, the manager wants a combination of appsec and netsec. That plays right into my programming background  


\-----------------------------------------------

How do you all react to this? Is the architecture role worth considering? Or not? My biggest concern is it being more abstract and not technically involved hands-on.

1chg03j,cybersecurity,RemarkableNobody,2024-05-01 07:18:21,1714547901,"I’m begging you, please… give a perspective of this industry that’s different from what I’ve seen.","In advance, truly, I apologize. I know this isn’t r/antiwork, but I really need outside opinions from peers here. 

Just got punted out of my 4th job in 5 years. Don’t want to say the specialization - I feel like it’s a tight crowd - but I’m sure I’ll tell on myself partway through here anyway. 

Please bear with me. I don’t just want to complain, the practices I’ve seen have made me truly worried about the geopolitical and ethical implications of what this means for the future.

I never made it to any big time firms… which probably worked out for me anyway, but I keep getting dropped for failure to integrate with the culture. Or not being a team player. Didn’t keep my camera off/abuse anybody, but it was more like…

“Hey, we’re totally committing commercial software license fraud.”
“Hey, we’re totally cooking our books and manufacturing invoiced work that never happened.”
“Hey, we’re totally fabricating our SME presence.”
“Hey, we’re totally lying to this client… and they’re making ME do it.”
“Hey, managers are totally taking credit for other people’s work to conduct bonus fraud.”


Queue dirty looks, abusive reprimands, and a constant reminders that “u/RemarkableNobody is a perfectionist, and if you want to make it in this field you really shouldn’t conduct yourself like they do.” I’m not even going to talk much about the stonewalling I always got when trying to move to positions with better fit, or trying to work with my managers when things aren’t working out. What’s the point? We all already know about it. I just wanted to do my job to a standard. 

Fellas… fellettes… I’m just so fucking exhausted. I went to an expensive school to be a SME in the security space. I *loved* helping businesses - and the people in those businesses - get with the program and keep their networks safe. I have a disgusting amount of experience doing my boss’s job because they just *wouldn’t do it* and make me panic-deliver shit work, make me deliver the cover story, then say: “hoowee, we made it happen, that’s what makes us rockstars. Anyway, lie on the report please.” If anything were to spark up… the only one touching the mess is me.

I couldn’t enforce the very basics of safe architecture, a direct responsibility of my role. Had to watch OWASP vectors flap in the wind for huge networks. Had to greenlight shit setups because it would be too expensive to get “that hung up on one client, they’ll be fine.”

Anything goes wrong, fuck it, E&O coverage and the legal team exists right?

All my MSP partner teams would just be criminals. Shit goes wrong, they flush the evidence and say “oops teehee.” Nobody gets in trouble. And all around me, Fortune 50s are ignoring kindergarten warning signs while every major sensitive database makes it to the dark market, public and private. Meanwhile, all the big firms and tech giants are devaluing these skills and expecting more and more from anyone they do hire. I’m a personal privacy activist and my heart breaks every day.   

I’ve been totally insomniac for 2 years. I watch the sun come up and cry. I log out of my workstation and puke into a toilet. I break shit, I scream, I hide from everyone. I did everything I could to be a quiet professional, but it feels like I’ve just been gaslit into ignoring the absolute state of enterprise security compliance. And now I think I’ve lost it. 


I’m wrong, aren’t I? Most of you had a better experience than I did, surely - I really think all I need to hear is some simple reassurance that we are not all working for criminals and charlatans who get to do anything they want because the state of security compliance enforcement is a joke… and not everyone is gutting entire business units because executives need to rabidly lie about being two seconds from complete insolvency. It can’t just be all private equity-sourced hostile takeovers… good talent and good teams getting thrown aside (not me, colleagues with much more to lose) for nickels on leadership bonuses…


This is a mess, I know. But I really need to get set straight. Everyone I was supposed to respect professionally tells me I’m wrong, so I must be. If that’s true, I’ll just wipe the dirt off my pants and keep at this.

I just can’t right now.

Fast forward three months into this new role, and it's... quite intense. It's predominantly policy-oriented work, much more than I anticipated. I had hoped for a bit more involvement with IT and Information Security, assisting with system implementations, educational initiatives, ensuring alignment with frameworks like NIST, and actively participating in their implementation. However, the reality is that my responsibilities lean heavily towards auditing, policy drafting, and procedure development.

While I did express my aspirations to my manager before accepting the role—emphasizing my desire for hands-on experience in Engineering—they still saw me as a fit for this position and mentioned the potential for other opportunities down the line if this one didn't align with my expectations.

Despite my dissatisfaction with the role itself, the company , culture and overall environment are fantastic. There's ample opportunity for growth, which is what initially drew me in, even though the position wasn't precisely what I had in mind.

My view is that most of these articles and media stories are specifically about SOC analysts who run into the wall of alert fatigue, which is a very real issue.

I went from working 20-30 hour weeks to close to 50, and I usually have to work weekends to catch up. So I’m now looking at 60 hour weeks. I didn’t realize how much the team leads were working outside of normal work hours. 

I’ve been with the company less than a year, there’s about 50 employees, and in that time 3-4 people a month have either quit or gotten fired. It’s a revolving door company with c suite executives that are full of hot heads, which is why the workload is so high since no one sticks around long enough to become proficient at what they do and having to constantly train new hires.

I really want to hold this job title with a different company and the pay raise was nice.

In my opinion, being fired is way harder to explain than wanting to leave shortly after being promoted. I’ve never felt so on eggshells with a company, because I’ve seen even the top performers get fired for voicing their opinions on how processes can be improved to decrease workloads.

I've been working full time at a University in the IT department as a Service Desk Technician Tier II for the last 10+ months, three weeks ago, received a promotion to Tech Support Specialist Tier II. 

During my time, I would troubleshoot network related issues, make Powershell scripts, handle virtual machine setups for students, and remediate a lot of endpoints off our network through reimaging, data restoration, and collaboration with our Information Security team(they'd isolate it off the network to an unauthenticated domain). 

As a student, I did an internship with them and realized I really enjoy information security, especially after handling so many remediation tickets working in service desk.

In the past year I've had to spend a lot of time studying for and earning the SSCP and re-earning the Security+.

A lot of my free time is gradually getting eaten up by this job.

Things that are eating up my free time:

1.) Having to study for and earn Linux+ before the year is out. This is done after 5PM and on weekends.

2.) Having to earn a Splunk certificate before the year is out. This is also done after 5PM and on weekends.

3.) Becoming an expert on Application Security. In addition to working on the other two other requirements from my job listed above, I've been told I should be studying and absorbing information on AppSec. So, I've been doing that too - off hours, as requested.

4.) Return to office. I'm now losing at least an hour a week of personal time from the commute to the office. More days will be required soon too, from what I've been told as we're said the goal is to get everyone back in 5 days a week. 

5.) Getting late night calls when alerts go off.

6.) Getting more and more tasks assigned to me that can only be done after hours and on weekends (running scans, validating changes work, and so on).



I'm not 100% sure this is the career path for me if this is going to be the next 20 years of my life, and that's fine. I don't know if I should try to look for other cyber security jobs at other companies, or if this is par for the course in the field and I need to adjust my study plan to migrate into something else career wise.

  
Can you provide me with honest input? I'm okay with being told I'm not cut out for this line of work. I just feel like bit by bit I'm losing the ability to spend time with my family and friends, and I'm even seeing a mental health counselor at this point too because I'm so miserable.","Burnout - CS Career Questions

- Previous military service
- Have a decent entry level cert (SANS) but no other IT experience other than cybersecurity focused self learning.
- Landed Tier 1 SOC analyst role at a very good MSSP (been here 6 months now)
- Have taken to it like a bird to flight and have excelled. I regularly get great feedback from T3 analysts and above. I'm always inquisitive and have learned so much. However, I can start to see the knowledge ceiling approach for on-the-job learning. I doubt a promotion is awaiting despite the good feedback.
- Currently working on some MS certs when I get the chance.

I really love the work itself. I went to my first major industry event and did some awesome networking. The biggest problem with my role is the shift work, the constantly changing shifts are just a killer and on my days off I have so little motivation to do any more learning. By the time I get myself into the zone it is already the opposite shift schedule and I have close to 0 time to study due to commuting to work.

I'm pretty much desperate to move to a new role that is 9-5, as with some consistency in life I feel I can accelerate my learning so much. I would like to land a security engineer role, or perhaps Jr pentester. Even a security analyst that is a more generic role than isolated to the SOC would be worth a move.

How do I beef up my résumé to land those kind of roles? I can very confidently talk about what I do at work, but the theoretical knowledge has started to dwindle as I haven't kept up.

I thought about investing some cash into a homelab setup. Probably an ESXI-based AD environment with a couple of client VMs, maybe a honeypot, PFSense firewall. Anything to get some different type of practise and to start learning new things as I'm gradually being less and less challenged in this way at work.

Kinda just wanted to share my experience and worries about my first security role, and perhaps if anyone has gone down a similar path.

I got my first security role as a SOC Analyst about 2 months ago. I believe, among other things, luck had a great play in me getting in, for which I am so so grateful, the work is super interesting and I work with the best colleagues I've ever had.

However, I've never felt more lost and incompetent at any other point in my life. I have about 2 years of experience in network support, have taken additional courses/certs in networking, Windows and Linux system administration, and cyber, but coming here it seems as if it would've been the same whether I had that or not.

The amount of knowledge I feel like I'm lacking in the tools, methodologies and way of thinking, and even at times fundamental concepts seems so much that it feels I'll be let go off before I catch up to even half of it.

Each time I build up some confidence, something else pops up that completely shatters it and I feel like I'm even worse than I was at day one.

I have some courses/practical certs planned out, but that does take time too.

Has anyone felt like this is way beyond their abilities but turned out fine? How long did it take you?

I’ve been there almost two years and it is becoming apparent to me that I’m not enjoying the technical aspect anymore. I am also throughly and completely burned out. At this point I have become a ticket jockey and I seem to have a target on my back, as I recently discovered I was being thrown under the bus for a process I was supposed to follow, among a few other things I was not supposed to find out.

I have reached out to a recruiter and hoping to jump ship as soon as possible. I mentioned to the recruiter that I’ve had a lot of interest lately in compliance, and so I’m hoping that I can somehow get aligned with that aspect instead of another SOC. I reached out to a CISO recently within my company that has actually been really excited about mentoring me and I wanted to get some hands-on experience working with them before I left the company. He has so far, been very helpful in just one meeting alone introducing me to the GRC side of things.

The job itself has genuinely become unbearable and I’m sure a lot of the issues that I’m running into are in regards to how the office is run, but I’m looking to move on entirely. I understand I face some difficulty in maybe moving around considering this has been my first and only tech job.

My current company is pretty decent overall. Great people and culture, okay salary, ""unlimited"" PTO (that's not even real, I don't know how that term even flies anymore), and I do get to work remote. Problem is that I am either bored to tears on days with minimal work or I am working 60+ hour weeks with travel, onsite consulting, etc. and not much balance in between. It's affecting my personal happiness and relationships, I'm getting burnt out, and I don't like where this is headed. I'm starting to dread the daily mundane nature of my work that I once had such a genuine interest in. I still love parts of it, but man, it just doesn't have the flair it once did.

Since the beginning of the year, I have applied to somewhere near 200 positions that are local / onsite or remote for a vast range of industries. I've been spending a lot of time prowling LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, InfoSec Jobs, TrueUp, USAJobs, and countless random software / startup companies that I am attracted to hoping that one day I find my next stepping stone. I've had ONE phone interview between all of this, for an underpaid position, that turned out to be a flop. They literally told me that the position no longer exists and they don't have the budget for it. I have received countless ""Thanks for applying..."" emails with zero luck and it's beginning to feel like I took a wrong turn somewhere or luck is not on my side. I understand that the economy isn't amazing and this is an extremely saturated market in mid-2024, but am I missing something? I'm at the point of picking up a local IT / SysAdmin job just to have a more exciting change of pace while the InfoSec industry figures itself out. Am I crazy?

- Read Team: if you can do it, go for it because it is very rewarding and that's where you can find most ""pros"".

- Blue Team: you will learn a lot and has a wide variety of roles and most job offers are for Blue Team anyway.

- SOC: only do it if it is extremely necessary. Avoid it all you can, and if you have to do it, get away as soon as possible.

Now, my question is, how true is this? Is a SOC where cybersecurity careers go to die?

It's obvious that a SOC Analyst Tier 1 should try to to move up quickly, but aren't Incident Response and Threat Hunting (considered in many SOCs Tier 2 and Tier 3 respectively) good places to be?

Is the only ""proper"" way up to become a Security Engineer? Can't a good Threat Hunter have the same consideration as a SecEng?","Get far away from SOC?
So I was talking with a CISO recently, and he said he makes the following distinction:

- Read Team: if you can do it, go for it because it is very rewarding and that's where you can find most ""pros"".

- Blue Team: you will learn a lot and has a wide variety of roles and most job offers are for Blue Team anyway.

- SOC: only do it if it is extremely necessary. Avoid it all you can, and if you have to do it, get away as soon as possible.

Now, my question is, how true is this? Is a SOC where cybersecurity careers go to die?

I know this has come up before and been posted a few times but I would like fresh answers and ideas based on my current position.

I started as an L1 SOC analyst at a MSSP for about 2 years before being burnt out from shifts, undelivered promises and hitting the skill-level causing me to become bored.   
I then moved on to another company providing MSSP and CySec consulting as just a ""SOC Analyst"" where there are no levels/tiers. I was the first SOC analyst to be hired. Besides the day-to-day monitoring/threat hunting/RCA activities of an analyst, I also deploy, integrate and manage the SIEM/XDR tools to all our clients and new clients that come on. Additionally, I also do the IR and consulting monthly with clients at the C-level.  
Even some Vulnerability management and testing.

I have become the go to person when it comes to all thing SOC mentioned above.  
  
I am tired of being on-call all the time, having to work shifts and just generally being on the SOC.

Besides being heavily underpaid, I am not happy, not challenged and getting bored again.  
I feel like I'm going no where. Hitting the ceiling again etc.

Any advice on where to move towards in my career as well as how to start getting there would be highly appreciated :}","Moving on and up from SOC? Not sure on first steps

I'm currently at a crossroads with my job, and I could use some advice. I recently graduated with a bachelor’s in cybersecurity and had two job offers when I finished school. One was for an IT auditing position in SOC, and the other was for a security analyst role. I have about 2 years of helpdesk experience and 1 year of cybersecurity analyst experience under my belt. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to earn any certifications during my university days due to a lack of funding.

I ended up choosing the IT auditing job, and I've been at it for about 6 months now. To be honest, I find the work quite mundane and boring. The upside is that I usually finish my tasks early, which gives me a lot of free time during the day. The job also offers fast promotions due to the heavy workload, and there's potential to transition into the Pen Testing branch if I obtain an OSCP certification—assuming a spot opens up.

I'm torn between sticking it out for another year or year and a half in hopes of moving into Pen Testing or exploring more technical roles right away. On one hand, the job pays the bills, and it’s remote, which is great and I’ve made some great friends so far and they raise pretty fast, for example once I hit a year of being here I’m moved up 10-15k on my salary. On the other hand I’m really just struggling to want to doing this work, it’s not really interesting to me or makes me want to wake up and do this, the workload is also high,the expectations of making profit are always high and if we have a low income year we get laid off, management is good but really doesn’t help with the workload and we are basically work mules for them.

I really enjoy technical projects like tackling challenging problems like coding projects, working on CTFs, and doing raspberry pi projects. I'm also intrigued by careers in data science, cloud computing, and blockchain development. I have experience with C, Java, HTML, and Linux/Kali Linux, which I’d love to leverage more in my work.

Is this feeling of dissatisfaction normal for a first ""big"" job? Should I wait and see if the opportunity for a more engaging role opens up here, or start working on my portfolio and looking for something more aligned with my interests? Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks in advance! And advice that you give as well is much appreciated.","Stuck on career advancement

1fiv3bs,cybersecurity,Fuuck_iT,2024-09-17 09:57:49,1726567069,I'm having doubts after my first day as SOC Analyst L1,"Yesterday, I started my first day as an SOC Analyst L1 at a consulting firm in my city.

This consulting firm is one of the largest in my city, with around 500 employees, and has been in operation for over 20 years. Before landing the SOC Analyst role, I was working as a Help Desk technician at the same company for about six months. When the opportunity arose to join the SOC team, I volunteered for the position. The SOC itself has been running for less than a year—it's a long-term project, and right now, we have only three clients who have signed up for the service. A government organization in my country allocated a relatively large budget (around 3 million dollars) to establish the SOC, mainly to support small and medium-sized businesses. Although we already have clients, the SOC is still in development.

Currently, the team consists of three SOC Analyst L1s, two L2s, and four other people working more on the infrastructure side of the SOC, supported by the budget I mentioned earlier.

On my first day, one of my colleagues walked me through the infrastructure and tools we use. I handled a few alerts, and to be honest, there are very few alerts—enough that one or two L1 analysts could easily manage them without needing extra help. He also told me that alerts are rarely escalated to L2; most of them involve IPs trying to scan ports or brute-force their way into a service. The rest of the alerts are more informational, like if a user suddenly deletes a large number of files from their device or erases a lot of emails.

Honestly, I find the SOC quite lacking in terms of alert activity, and I’m concerned that I won’t be learning much here… I'm not sure if this is normal or not.

I'm debating whether to stay for a few more months to gain experience as an SOC Analyst and then look for a job elsewhere. Right now, my only experience is six months in Help Desk. I have the Security+ certification, and I plan to take the CySA+ at the end of the year.

Maybe I'm rushing things and expecting too much too soon, but the SOC gives me the impression of being a somewhat neglected service within the organization. I see half-written documentation, some outdated resources, and unclear procedures. It feels like there's no one really overseeing the SOC closely.","I'm having doubts after my first day as SOC Analyst L1

1fjvmnj,cybersecurity,TruthPuzzleheaded757,2024-09-18 15:29:04,1726673344,"Burntout and unfulfilled, considering career change","Hi, hoping to generate some perspective and ideas about this situation.

  
Quick background: Early 30s, graduated with a B.S. in Cybersec a few years ago. Final four semesters were also spent working as a student mentor for a government funded grant program given to my school to host a college-level credit offering ""cybersec intro"" course for high school students (only noting this as a CIA rep I spoke to said this is highly appealing to any govt-sector hiring process). 

Was hired shortly after graduation by my current company. Began as an L1 SOC analyst for our at the time newly stood up managed service platform as an original member since day 1 - so I've seen it grow through all its ups and downs. Both my company and our client pool consist of numerous world-leading orgs in aerospace, financial, healthcare, etc. industries. In terms of exposure, have gotten to experience some pretty cool things in this regard. Time spent here was obviously pretty basic ticket work but I personally liked to dive into things to the best of my ability which stood out.

  
Quickly earned a promotion to L2 within the year, which I found to be ""the spot"", felt like I was doing meaningful (at least more than now) work, was getting deeper hands-on experience in client environments, tools, etc. and was being handed client requests and incidents for deeper work, much of which received accolades. Ticket work burnt me out too but a year or so later was given the bump to a lead role. This is where it began to stagnate. Rarely do I touch security work anymore and I suppose that's just the course of things. But, I want to do security...work now consists of all the behind-the-scenes BS that I'm sure many of us are familiar with, 20 meetings a day, upper mgmt starting and stopping new projects every week, senseless reviews and audits for busy work, tasks that should be ahem cough automated, it's just become a total slog. Been at this role now for roughly 7-8 months and realistically, the only way forward, is yet an even more management-heavy role which I do NOT want. Management is not something I desire to do in any way, I just know this about myself and have no interest in further moving into mgmt in any capacity. Which brings me to this consideration to change careers. 

""Look into incident response, threat hunt/intel, risk"" you might suggest. Sadly have, and unfortunately, at least within my current company, these are not viable. IR and Threat are either outsourcing(ed) to our India teams explicitly or have a hire-freeze in place. Additionally, they all route through each other in some capacity so without one it's basically impossible to move into another, thus starts the loop again of need job for experience can't get job without experience. Simply put, I was essentially told it's not going to happen, and do not have enough confidence that it will to wait around for it.

  
This brings me to \*why\* I'm staying: six figure remote work, four day work weeks, robust benefits, and including holidays about 8 weeks PTO/year. It feels borderline stupid to even consider leaving but at what point does burnout exceed the benefits?

Criminology interests me greatly and I've considered school again (though not my first choice ideally, at least not another four years) to pursue a criminology/forensics degree to tie into security.

Hi, hoping to generate some perspective and ideas about this situation.

  
Quick background: Early 30s, graduated with a B.S. in Cybersec a few years ago. Final four semesters were also spent working as a student mentor for a government funded grant program given to my school to host a college-level credit offering ""cybersec intro"" course for high school students (only noting this as a CIA rep I spoke to said this is highly appealing to any govt-sector hiring process). 

Was hired shortly after graduation by my current company. Began as an L1 SOC analyst for our at the time newly stood up managed service platform as an original member since day 1 - so I've seen it grow through all its ups and downs. Both my company and our client pool consist of numerous world-leading orgs in aerospace, financial, healthcare, etc. industries. In terms of exposure, have gotten to experience some pretty cool things in this regard. Time spent here was obviously pretty basic ticket work but I personally liked to dive into things to the best of my ability which stood out.

  
Quickly earned a promotion to L2 within the year, which I found to be ""the spot"", felt like I was doing meaningful (at least more than now) work, was getting deeper hands-on experience in client environments, tools, etc. and was being handed client requests and incidents for deeper work, much of which received accolades. Ticket work burnt me out too but a year or so later was given the bump to a lead role. This is where it began to stagnate. Rarely do I touch security work anymore and I suppose that's just the course of things. But, I want to do security...work now consists of all the behind-the-scenes BS that I'm sure many of us are familiar with, 20 meetings a day, upper mgmt starting and stopping new projects every week, senseless reviews and audits for busy work, tasks that should be ahem cough automated, it's just become a total slog. Been at this role now for roughly 7-8 months and realistically, the only way forward, is yet an even more management-heavy role which I do NOT want. Management is not something I desire to do in any way, I just know this about myself and have no interest in further moving into mgmt in any capacity. Which brings me to this consideration to change careers. 

""Look into incident response, threat hunt/intel, risk"" you might suggest. Sadly have, and unfortunately, at least within my current company, these are not viable. IR and Threat are either outsourcing(ed) to our India teams explicitly or have a hire-freeze in place. Additionally, they all route through each other in some capacity so without one it's basically impossible to move into another, thus starts the loop again of need job for experience can't get job without experience. Simply put, I was essentially told it's not going to happen, and do not have enough confidence that it will to wait around for it.

  
This brings me to \*why\* I'm staying: six figure remote work, four day work weeks, robust benefits, and including holidays about 8 weeks PTO/year. It feels borderline stupid to even consider leaving but at what point does burnout exceed the benefits?

Criminology interests me greatly and I've considered school again (though not my first choice ideally, at least not another four years) to pursue a criminology/forensics degree to tie into security. Had basic exposure to law and forensics tools and processes in college, nothing that I would list as meaningful for a job application, but I highly enjoyed what I experienced. However, I'm very unfamiliar with that move process without some form of LEO or law-aligned experience. A note: I can get vouchers for SANS and similar training through work assuming it fits my role, but seeking unrelated training will throw up some flags.

Pathetic, I know. I’m not the best at anything other than art and that’s not a career path I trust too much.

I’ve been psyching myself out, and since I have no experience whatsoever in tech, I haven’t really grasped anything in any of the classes I’ve taken.

School has never been my strong suit, and in the past I’ve tried other career paths, went to school, and would drop out, or fail and never end up trying again. 

I really want to finish something in life And my family is helping me financially with this program so me staying in this program is the only option. 

I really need some motivational words (roast me) so I won’t slip into depression. And also if anyone has a very… descriptive… roadmap for dummies guide, that would really help too.

1focakd,cybersecurity,miller131313,2024-09-24 13:19:02,1727183942,Burnout in cybersecurity ,"Hey all,

I've been working in cybersecurity for several years now, mainly across the energy sector in some very large enterprise environments. I have always been on the blue team side of things and have spent a considerable amount of time grinding at each employer; continuous learning through obtaining many certs, attending conferences, and striving to be a high performer in the workplace by taking on as much work as I could so I'd be recognized as somebody of importance and value to the org. I want to be someone people can trust and depend on to get things done. 

Through this, I found myself reaching the top of the pay scale as an individual contributor at my current org with a few years and transitioned into a cyber management role over a year ago. I was not necessarily prepared for this. I had no prior management experience and I did not really have a mentor, or a boss willing to share their knowledge with me.

Within the last 6 months I'm feeling so incredibly burned out. It's to the point where I don't care if I get fired/laid off. In fact, I long for it. All I think about is work, how much is one my plate and how much I can't stand it. Even when I am productive I get no enjoyment or fulfilment out of it. None of the projects interest me and it's so hard to push through. 

What are some things I can do to get myself out of this? I've taken time off to try and ""recharge"", yet I come back feeling worse and filled with existential dread. I'm very grateful for my career, but it is weighing very heavily on me. Any advice from those that have experienced this?","Burnout in cybersecurity

Burnout and Impostor Syndrome will happen several times in a security career. While many ask about *how* to overcome it, the real question is *why* *does this happen?*

IMO, the main reason is we have very demotivational work in a misunderstood field. Our field is powered by negativity, justified with skepticism, and influenced by those who don't work with us on a daily basis.

We stop bad things from happening. An exciting day at work usually involves a crime, e.g., the organization we've been tasked with defending was attacked. A good day usually means our designs worked, but nobody noticed because they were able to do their jobs.

Breaches are happening everywhere and nobody seems to get punished effectively for it. In fact, *some get jobs* - by the very government asking us to defend better - *because of it*.

Tech is evolving faster than any other field, innovative companies are trying to adopt it a few months after initial release, and we need to be at least 3 months ahead of it, which means researching beta releases and conceiving the guardrails for something that may not even be a thing.

On a personal relations level, we're not a fun group to work with. People don't like dealing with password changes, MFA, firewall rules that block them from uploading files to customers, mandatory email encryption, etc. because we get in their way.

Audits ain't fun: It's not what you did, it's what you can prove you did. You have to back up every claim with documentation, logs, etc., that you typically don't think about unless you've failed an audit before. The auditors rarely know the ins and outs of how much effort it takes to meet compliance (regardless of what some will say, it is not easy) and they've got the ear of the BoD.

Finally, there's the cost. Breaches are expensive, so we're expensive. It's not difficult to see why the CFO scrutinizes our expenses when there's not any revenue coming in from the cyber folks. As messed up as it sounds in this forum, it makes financial sense to weigh ""how much would the ransom cost?"" vs. ""how much do these 4 technologies to mitigate ransomware risk cost?""

When we get out of our rhythm and look at our own situation it's easy to stare off and ask ""why do I bother doing this?"" ...and **that's** when the burnout starts.

**So how do we counteract the above? By remembering the reason we wanted to do this in the first place. FIND YOUR WHY** (supporting your family? being on the edge of tech? protecting people?)**, print it, and use it for motivation.**

And, for the love of all things holy, have a sense of humor about it. Laugh or you'll cry.

The Simpsons did exactly that in ""[And Maggie Makes Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Maggie_Makes_Three).""","Regarding burnout: Understanding WHY is paramount

So I just took a federal job as an ISSM and I had a bad feeling since day one. Let me lay the situation out for you. My previous job was in the private sector at a large defense contractor where I was an ISSE. I loved my job and I loved the company, but with any private company you have its cons. My reason for leaving was simply because it was a federal job, which offered job security, better benefits, and ability to have a pension.

While all of those points are awesome, does it matter if you hate the job? I am a highly technical person and I enjoy being in the systems and working, which is what my last job was. This new one is a compliance role, which is just a bunch of paperwork and pushing policies on programs that I support. On day one my manager was complaining all day, saying how this work sucks, the people suck, and how she cant wait until she is done with it and or retires. The pay is comparable as they matched my pay so that isn't one of my concerns.

* Federal Job:
   * Pros:
      * Better benefits
      * Job Security
      * Ability to invest into a pension
      * Every other Friday off, and ability to telecommute 50%

      * The people do not seem excited or motivated to be there
      * My manager told me she hopes I do good so I can help pick up the slack of others
      * Pay as you progress in your career isnt as good as in the private sector.
* Previous Job:
   * Pros:
      * I enjoyed the work and got every Friday off
      * The people were excited to be there and wanted to work

   * Cons:
      * Potential layoffs/restructuring as you have with any private company
      * Health benefits aren't nearly as good, but they offer an amazing 401k and HSA program

I HATE being an intern. Don’t get me wrong, I’m beyond grateful to even have a position in today’s job market, but the title feels like a punch in the face considering the effort I’m putting in. I’ve worked hard, get regular praise from colleagues for my work, and they genuinely value what I bring to the team. But somehow, it feels like I'm playing the ""intern"" game wrong.

There’s not much expected of you as an intern. They say you’re mostly there to learn, but how can I stand around and just learn all day? Well, obviously no sane person in my field would do that. I didn’t just shadow. I took on tasks, tackled incident response, got brought into projects, and became skilled at so many different technologies.

After six months, I felt ready for a full-time position. I was balancing school, getting certifications, and putting in real work every day to drive and make change. Of course, this is not up to me to decide when I’ll get an offer.

My company acknowledged my interest in going full-time, yet gave me the “after you graduate” talk. Due to “legal” and “tax” reasons, they said I had to stay an intern until I finish my degree in May 2025. My only thought was - *are you serious?* But really? Shouldn’t I decide how much I can handle as a student?

  
I suspect there's more to the story -  probably about budgets, but the official explanation feels like another punch in the face.

Then there’s school. My experience on the job has taught me more about cybersecurity in 14 months than my degree has in almost four years. 

The irony is that many of my colleagues don’t even have degrees in cyber. They came from different fields, took a cert or two, and got the job. Yet here I am, balancing school, getting certifications, and building real work experience—only to be told I still need the piece of paper before I can move forward.

Anyone else been in this position? How do you view the “intern” title in a positive light? And what’s the right work ethic for an intern? For me, I keep feeling like I need to match full-timers. I feel I have so much value to provide, but providing that value as an intern doesn't feel right.

*And yes, I am applying to other places, and I will continue to do so...*

Due to “legal” and “tax” reasons, they said I had to stay an intern until I finish my degree in May 2025. My only thought was - *are you serious?* But really? Shouldn’t I decide how much I can handle as a student?

  
I suspect there's more to the story -  probably about budgets, but the official explanation feels like another punch in the face.

Then there’s school. My experience on the job has taught me more about cybersecurity in 14 months than my degree has in almost four years. 

The irony is that many of my colleagues don’t even have degrees in cyber. They came from different fields, took a cert or two, and got the job. Yet here I am, balancing school, getting certifications, and building real work experience—only to be told I still need the piece of paper before I can move forward.

Anyone else been in this position? How do you view the “intern” title in a positive light? And what’s the right work ethic for an intern? For me, I keep feeling like I need to match full-timers. I feel I have so much value to provide, but providing that value as an intern doesn't feel right.

*And yes, I am applying to other places, and I will continue to do so...*",frustrated with being an intern despite feeling like a full timer. i m going to sound an ungrateful sob to all those who have yet to secure internships or any cyber related position but.... i hate being an intern. don t get me wrong i m beyond grateful to even have a position in today s job market but the title feels like a punch in the face considering the effort i m putting in. i ve worked hard get regular praise from colleagues for my work and they genuinely value what i bring to the team. but somehow it feels like i m playing the intern game wrong. there s not much expected of you as an intern. they say you re mostly there to learn but how can i stand around and just learn all day well obviously no sane person in my field would do that. i didn t just shadow. i took on tasks tackled incident response got brought into projects and became skilled at so many different technologies. after six months i felt ready for a full time position. i was balancing school getting certifications and putting in real work every day to drive and make change. of course this is not up to me to decide when i ll get an offer. my company acknowledged my interest in going full time yet gave me the after you graduate talk. due to legal and tax reasons they said i had to stay an intern until i finish my degree in may     . my only thought was   are you serious but really shouldn t i decide how much i can handle as a student i suspect there s more to the story   probably about budgets but the official explanation feels like another punch in the face. then there s school. my experience on the job has taught me more about cybersecurity in    months than my degree has in almost four years. the irony is that many of my colleagues don t even have degrees in cyber. they came from different fields took a cert or two and got the job. yet here i am balancing school getting certifications and building real work experience only to be told i still need the piece of paper before i can move forward. anyone else been in this position how do you view the intern title in a positive light and what s the right work ethic for an intern for me i keep feeling like i need to match full timers. i feel i have so much value to provide but providing that value as an intern doesn t feel right. and yes i am applying to other places and i will continue to do so...,0,4,2449,2350,2024,10,Monday,1,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1gdqpjt/frustrated_with_being_an_intern_despite_feeling/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1gdqpjt/frustrated_with_being_an_intern_despite_feeling/,1,0.8931991064519462,0.8931991064519462,SVM (Linear)

And not just amateurishly clicking around forums and doing a few boxes. I mean utterly pathologically and obsessively researching; building systems and networks, breaking into them, patching them, re-writing them; trying to cram as many years of experience as possible in as little time as possible. Over and over again, a never ending cycle of deep-dives and retracting back to the basics to make sure my foundations were solid, and back to more deep-dives.

Basic networking, linux/windows sysadmin skills (i.e package management, scripting, Infra-as-code, etc), ICS/SCADA, radio manipulation, embedded systems, automotive security, malware dev, Appsec, DevOps, DFIR, GRC, and so on. I'd pick a certification and read every study guide I could find online for it, knowing damn well I'd never be able to pay for it. I'd implement the concepts in a home lab to solidify everything I've learned.

And after a decade of learning, meanwhile applying for jobs and rewriting my resume over and over again... I've virtually gotten nowhere. I've worked for two different start-up companies that dissolved due to marketing failures, and the one established company i worked for (an MSP) had to let me go after a few months because they lost a big client. Ever since that one MSP let me go (which I'll re-iterate, was through no fault of my own), I've been stuck working in the food industry, factories and gas stations.

The worst part of it all, is that my obsession compelled me to at least try getting into the same buildings as the people who had the jobs that I wanted, which only led me to look through a proverbial glass ceiling, wishing I could be on top. An example is working at a food place on Fort Meade. I got to meet and talk to cybersecurity professionals all the time, if only in passing. For 2-3 minutes while they would wait for an order, I'd get to listen to them about what they do (albeit in a filtered way; clearances on the line and all). But at the end of the day, while I waited for the bus to go back home, all I could think is I would never get there. But I kept on pushing through anyways... for years even after that.

I worked at a gas station in Baltimore, where I also got to meet DB admins and SOC analysts as well... again, only in passing. Job after job, I'd find myself talking with highly skilled and intelligent professionals that I admire, only to feel a paradoxical rising resentment as time passed. I worked so fucking hard to be where they are, only to be the cashier that gave them their lunch and cigarettes.

As far as I know, no resume has ever gotten past an ATS and into a real person's inbox, and if it did, it was probably for a ghost job.

I'm just done, man. Pretty sure I'm just going to pivot to a career that plays to my other strengths like engineering, neuroscience or chemistry. Those student loans are gonna be real easy on my bank account. /s","Burnout rant

Just to give the environment and workload im working with - SIEM- Splunk, XDR-palo alto cortex, email security-mimecast, Zscaler, AWS - Guarduty, Akamai- CDN, WAF.   
  
Fortunately there are still some good people i work across other teams like IAM, cloudsec, grc, infra sec, but i did not have enough time to colaborate with them and learn from them. I want to utilise this time to learn something from them as well.  
 As L1, i just investigate alerts that i get in jira tickets and if there are any true positives, will escalate them to L2 and work with them till the issue gets resolved. I believe SIEM is like the most important tool ? Idk because it's like a place where i have spent most of my time with. I want to get better at building queries and dont know how. Other than that our L2s go through hacker news threat intel reports and if they find anything of relevance for our org, they assign us to do threat hunting excercise for our org. That's about it.  
I'm a little weak in networking and finding really hard to analyse guard duty alerts.  
  
How can I utilise thIs environment and what are some concepts i can learn and implement.  Docs and resources i can read to get some skills.

Fortunately there are still some good people i work across other teams like IAM, cloudsec, grc, infra sec, but i did not have enough time to colaborate with them and learn from them. I want to utilise this time to learn something from them as well.  
 As L1, i just investigate alerts that i get in jira tickets and if there are any true positives, will escalate them to L2 and work with them till the issue gets resolved. I believe SIEM is like the most important tool ? Idk because it's like a place where i have spent most of my time with. I want to get better at building queries and dont know how. Other than that our L2s go through hacker news threat intel reports and if they find anything of relevance for our org, they assign us to do threat hunting excercise for our org. That's about it.  
I'm a little weak in networking and finding really hard to analyse guard duty alerts.  
  
How can I utilise thIs environment and what are some concepts i can learn and implement.  Docs and resources i can read to get some skills.  
  
Thanks in advance",i ll be leaving a soc role soon and want to know how i can take advatage during this time i m    f and had joined as soc analyst l    months ago. initially it was going great but it started to get toxic and i had to face some uncomfortable situations and subtle harassment. i had reported to my manager and things are going good for now but honestly i just want to leave. i m fine and nothing can be done with hr and all as i dont want to deal with it in my life right now. i just want to leave. for now it s going ok and before i leave i want to take this experience and make the most of it and learn as much as i can for me to land me a job somewhere else. i will probably be staying for another     months or less. what can i learn or utilise my time with so that i can have a solid foundation of it. just to give the environment and workload im working with   siem  splunk xdr palo alto cortex email security mimecast zscaler aws   guarduty akamai  cdn waf. fortunately there are still some good people i work across other teams like iam cloudsec grc infra sec but i did not have enough time to colaborate with them and learn from them. i want to utilise this time to learn something from them as well. as l  i just investigate alerts that i get in jira tickets and if there are any true positives will escalate them to l  and work with them till the issue gets resolved. i believe siem is like the most important tool idk because it s like a place where i have spent most of my time with. i want to get better at building queries and dont know how. other than that our l s go through hacker news threat intel reports and if they find anything of relevance for our org they assign us to do threat hunting excercise for our org. that s about it. i m a little weak in networking and finding really hard to analyse guard duty alerts. how can i utilise this environment and what are some concepts i can learn and implement. docs and resources i can read to get some skills. thanks in advance,1,1,2035,1991,2024,11,Saturday,16,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1gsqmjd/ill_be_leaving_a_soc_role_soon_and_want_to_know/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1gsqmjd/ill_be_leaving_a_soc_role_soon_and_want_to_know/,1,0.8666568799439328,0.8666568799439328,SVM (Linear)

I'm worried I'll hate what's next.

I've been in the industry over 10 years having started out as a pentest and later red team consultant. I transitioned to an R&D focused role building out SOC capabilities and incident management platforms, working closely with a large SOC team, while building tooling for a red team capability, and providing SME support for everything from incidents to red team engagements. I even worked in and around threat intel, solution engineering, and sales, it was a fantastic role. Then I left to start my own business and after completely burning out of both energy and cash, I'm looking for employment again. 

I'm extremely concerned that I haven't really found my ""thing"" yet as far as a typical career person goes, I guess I'm not one of those people but now I feel I need to be. I'm getting interviewed for roles from pentesting to security engineering management, but nothing appeals to me except the money. I'm also interviewing for a role as a high level software engineer in a company that effectively wants me to be the tech lead doing the very thing I've failed to do in my business. This one appeals to me the most albeit I've not had an offer so it could simply not be a real option.

I'm completely exhausted mentally, and I'd love to hear what people think about my concerns. Basically, I worry that I won't have adequate career progression in some of these roles, or I won't like them at all, but end up stuck because my most recent experience will make it such that I can't transition into something senior enough in a role I prefer to match my expectations (salary and influence - I love autonomy). My skillset is diverse, and I guess I've gravitated towards this sort of builder of security solutions type role without thinking about it, but now I feel like I need to see a reasonably clear path for progression into more senior / leadership roles, as my adventure into entrepreneurship has failed. This one worries me the most, as it feels like I'm really venturing into software engineering in a specific security niche, I worry this pigeon hole will be incredibly hard to get out of if I find it's a mistake. I'd like to scratch some technical and leadership itches now, but I imagine the latter will appeal to me the older I get. What are the prospects here for me? I've also thought about advisory roles but they seem so GRC focused that I'd probably be considered under qualified.

As a side note / tangent, for me the industry seems broken. So many vendors and consultancies have been consolidated through acquisitions, leaving just a few huge vendors as viable options to land a job that would appeal to me, and they're either not hiring or have extremely high expectations of candidate experience in very specific areas. Thus going internal seems like the only viable way of getting paid in a way that reflects my experience. I'm truly just shocked as to how limited the job market has become for senior roles. I know numerous industry veterans that are in a similar position of not knowing what's next, these are people with more experience than I in varied roles. The industry used to be one of opportunities, now it feels like you're left to choose between low grade vendors who can't pay decent salaries but will offer big job titles, or super vendors that only hire once a year and / or have no senior level opportunities, or ones that have incredibly high and unrealistic expectations. If you didn't get into the right role at the right company about 5 years ago, it feels like your options are significantly limited.","Help figure out the next steps for my career, also the industry seems broken

I’ve been working as a SOC analyst for the past 4 years and recently joined a Big 4 firm about 3 months ago as an L2 analyst, supporting a large client. While it’s been exciting in some ways, I’m really struggling to adapt here.

Most of my teammates are already familiar with the tools and processes since they’ve been part of this project for a while. I, on the other hand, feel like I’m constantly playing catch-up. I haven’t been given access to all the tools yet, and just when I start to get a grip on something, there’s a new tool or process thrown into the mix. It’s overwhelming, and no matter how much I try, I feel like I’m not learning or contributing as much as I should be.

In my previous role with an MSS project, my tasks were mostly ticket-based, and the client-side team handled the resolution. I wasn’t directly working for a single client or communicating with end users, which, I realize now, has made the learning curve here even steeper.

On top of it, the rotational 24/7 shifts have been tough to handle. My previous job had fixed early morning shifts, which worked well for me, but this setup is really starting to take a toll. I honestly feel so overwhelmed at times that I’m considering quitting, even though this company was once my dream place to work and the pay is great.

That said, I’ve been thinking about moving away from SOC altogether and transitioning into roles like Threat Intelligence or Threat Hunting. I feel like these fields align better with my skills and interests, but I’m not sure how to start or what the roadmap looks like. Also, most cybersecurity job postings I see on LinkedIn seem to require 24/7 availability, and I wonder if that’s just the reality of the industry or if there are better options out there.

If anyone here has moved from SOC into Threat Intel or similar roles, I’d love to hear how you did it. Any advice, guidance, or even sharing your own experience would really help me right now.","Seeking Guidance on Transitioning from SOC to Threat Intelligence
