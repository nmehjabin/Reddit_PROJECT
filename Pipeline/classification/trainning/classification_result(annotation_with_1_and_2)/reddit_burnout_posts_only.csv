I write this seeking advice from those that were in GRC and got into a more technical role (others are also more than welcome) because I fucking HATE the job/work.

I'm not learning anything new and feel stuck/stagnant. I WANT OUT!

For context, I'm a mid-thirties European guy with a non-technical degree that took a professional one-year course on cybersecurity. Learned the basics, alongside programing (pyhton and C++), linux and windows and got a job in the GRC department. Thought it would be a good stepping stone into the industry and, after a year, I regret it. I want something more challenging and dynamic.

I'm considering, possibly, a move into SOC or Forensics (I like the investigative side of security) and am brushing up on the basics by doing CS50 and studying for the CCNA to start getting a few certifications under my belt, in order to compensate for lacking a technical degree.

So, want do you think? Is there hope for me?

Any part time Red Team/Pentesting jobs to look into?",under utilized and livid. how to stay motivated as the title states i am livid about not having a mission to conquer or technical leadership to learn from. this is especially true because our adversary in actively maneuvering and conquering while i sit on my hands and study... i am under contract for years to come and hate having nothing to do but study. i have had thousands of hours of training study and little ojt experience all mainly in cyber defense. i am one of the most trained and motivated people in my field that s in my organization with nothing to do. in addition most of my certs and focus is in red team this year i will be intermediate to advanced based on my organization and others of the like. my skills have reached a point where i feel suffocated with no true satisfaction besides cert chasing no co workers to talk to near the same level of technical capability and beyond insufficient pay to boot. i have been given opportunities that benefited my employer but little that i wanted to do. my organization has prevented incredible opportunities that have come up and when i addressed these issues i did not get a positive response. also the ceo of my organization said red team is not needed now and will be addressed in years to come. meaning my skill set is doa and almost worthless to pursue besides when i leave this organization. i ll preface my questions with: i already work out a heavy amount no vices study and read a significant amount and have appropriately projected my intent to my superiors. how do i keep my motivation for red team alive for years to come under these conditions suggestions to address my anger at having no mission to get after should i focus on changing my skill set from red team to a non cyber objective what are the best red team pentesting organizations agencies out there that people have worked for any part time red team pentesting jobs to look into,1,10,1946,1914,2024,1,Thursday,4,/r/cybersecurity/comments/18y3pha/under_utilized_and_livid_how_to_stay_motivated/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/18y3pha/under_utilized_and_livid_how_to_stay_motivated/,1,0.8753014491502525,0.8753014491502525,SVM (Linear)

I’ve never really posted on Reddit before so apologies for incorrect formatting etc.

Brief rundown of my IT experience, I have a Foundation Degree in Computing and I am currently working towards my Cybersecurity and Networking Infrastructure Degree through an apprenticeship. I have completed a few placements such as help desk roles previously during my Foundation degree.

I work directly under the Head of Technology who is a great boss and really nice guy. I am the only cybersecurity analyst in the company so I don’t really have anyone else in my team to learn from except from my boss who has been my main mentor. But he’s a very busy guy.

The whole point of this post is to ask for advice regarding things I should be doing to become better at my role and a better cyber security professional in general ,my long term plan is to complete my degree obviously then get my company to pay for me to complete some relevant certifications. But I would like some guidance for what I can do on the short term to continue progressing and developing. 

Also any advice on how to cope with imposter syndrome as I constantly struggle with feeling like I don’t deserve to be here. I know I haven’t been very specific but any advice is much appreciated. Thank you in advance! :)","Recently broke into cybersecurity and need advice for progression

I have the opportunity to help a friend set up a small cyber program for their small business, which is a good chance for me to work in a sandbox and practice a few skills. I apologise for this being a repetitive post that has been asked by others many times before.

Can I please get some feedback on the (very rough) plan I have put together so far?  


**Situation:**

A friend’s small business could use a cyber security overhaul. This suits me as an avenue to practice my governance, risk management, compliance, and engineering skills, all the while blogging about the process.

**Mission:**

Perform a micro v-ciso engagement, followed by an engineering engagement to implement the technical controls identified during the governance phase, a pentest to identify remaining weaknesses, and the implementation of a cyber security program for ongoing improvements and governance.

For this engagement, I will be acting as program manager, project manager, v-ciso, security engineer, GRC consultant, and system administrator.

**Execution:**

The project will be broken down into several phases. Each phase will have a unique statement of work, work breakdown structure, design documentation, and build documentation where appropriate. These can be treated as mini-projects, within the overall program.

1. vCISO engagement
    1. Risk analysis (VUCA?)
    2. Business impact analysis
    3. Asset management
    4. Vendor analysis
    5. Strategy development and management
    6. Roadmap development and management
    7. Policy development and management
    8. Framework compliance (Essential 8 - ML1)
    9. Other elements from (CISO Compass, Light and Fast Organisation)
2. Engineering engagement
    1. Creation of SOW and WBS for all engineering phases
    2. MDM uplift
        1. Intune vs. RMM?
    3. EDR uplift
        1. Include ASR rules
        2. Ransomware protection
    4. Email filter uplift
    5. Essential 8 controls implementation for ML1
        1. Patch management
        2. Application control

Hi, redditors! I have the opportunity to help a friend set up a small cyber program for their small business, which is a good chance for me to work in a sandbox and practice a few skills. I apologise for this being a repetitive post that has been asked by others many times before.

Can I please get some feedback on the (very rough) plan I have put together so far?  


**Situation:**

A friend’s small business could use a cyber security overhaul. This suits me as an avenue to practice my governance, risk management, compliance, and engineering skills, all the while blogging about the process.

**Mission:**

Perform a micro v-ciso engagement, followed by an engineering engagement to implement the technical controls identified during the governance phase, a pentest to identify remaining weaknesses, and the implementation of a cyber security program for ongoing improvements and governance.

For this engagement, I will be acting as program manager, project manager, v-ciso, security engineer, GRC consultant, and system administrator.

**Execution:**

The project will be broken down into several phases. Each phase will have a unique statement of work, work breakdown structure, design documentation, and build documentation where appropriate. These can be treated as mini-projects, within the overall program.

1. vCISO engagement
    1. Risk analysis (VUCA?)
    2. Business impact analysis
    3. Asset management
    4. Vendor analysis
    5. Strategy development and management
    6. Roadmap development and management
    7. Policy development and management
    8. Framework compliance (Essential 8 - ML1)
    9. Other elements from (CISO Compass, Light and Fast Organisation)
2. Engineering engagement
    1. Creation of SOW and WBS for all engineering phases
    2. MDM uplift
        1. Intune vs. RMM?
    3. EDR uplift
        1. Include ASR rules
        2. Ransomware protection
    4. Email filter uplift
    5. Essential 8 controls implementation for ML1
        1. Patch management
        2. Application control
        3. Application and OS hardening
        4. MFA
        5. Backups (additional regulatory requirement - onprem airgapped)
    6. CIS benchmark implementation

I’m just feeling very demotivated right now and I’m just wondering what am I doing wrong? 

Some context: I just graduated with my BS in Cybersecurity from a mid tech school which has a decent reputation for our computing major. I have 2 internships that is 3 and 8 months both in Cyber/SecOps. I also acquired Security+ and recently CCNA. 

Some limitations: I’m an international student (crazy right? Cyber + not US Citizen not a good combo) so government and any positions that require clearance or to be an US person is a no go. Some people would assume that I need sponsorship but I actually don’t need to, so when I apply I usually say no, it’s complicated. 

I have been applying to all sort of position entry and associate level, Security Engineer, Network Engineer, SOC Analyst, NOC Analyst, Security Analyst, Help Desk, IT Support, etc,… probably 250+ application. Basically most IT related positions, I do shy away from PenTest jobs and GRC since I don’t have much to show for those and not really want to go into them. It just feels so hard to keep on searching and applying knowing that most if not all of the applications I do might just be worthless. Talked to the Career Advisor at my school, the only thing she told me to do was to do more networking but it’s so awkward, though I tried to do that too, doesn’t seem to have any effect on my job search neither. 

Most of the people in my major graduate and have a job line up even before they graduate, I’m happy for them but at the same time it makes me doubt myself a lot. Just feels like anyone that graduated can land a job and not me, maybe it’s just not for me? I know it’s hard to find a job in this market and December + January might be a bit slower in hiring and stuff but dang it feels bad.

Well, that is both the rant and the context. The actual question is: What am I doing wrong? How can I find an entry level IT job? 

Any feedback and tip is appreciated. If you would like to see my resume please DM me! If you have an entry level opening and looking for someone please also DM me or comment below!

I'm about to finish my Bachelor's degree and contemplating the next step – whether to pursue a Master's degree (in IT/CS/IT-Sec) or certifications (e.g., OSCP).

My goal is to stay in a technical role for the next 5-6 years (at least), leaning towards the blue team/engineering/architectural side (basically what I currently do). I plan to work full-time while obtaining either the Master's degree or certifications during my spare time, as experience > everything.

Additional info:

* Most likely leaving my current employer later this year, so their advice may not be as relevant (they don't really care about degrees or certs).
* Interested in roles at other US BigTech/FAANG companies.
* Cost is manageable for both options (\~20k for Master's, ? for certs); i.e., spending as little as possible isn't my highest priority. I'm not relying on my employer to pay for it.
* From what I have seen in job postings, Master's degrees aren't commonly listed as requirements for technical roles; certs occasionally are.

I'd appreciate your insights on whether another \~2 years for a Master's degree is worth it, considering tthe additional value they provide for the time I need to invest.   
If you recommend certifications, which ones would make the most sense? I'd consider OSCP, but I'm unsure about other certifications. CISSP is on the radar, but I have 2 years left before I can take it.

198k1in,cybersecurity,finance-sister,2024-01-17 01:23:05,1705454585,Is staying in GRC worth it?,"Hi! I'm new to this community and I’m looking to open a little discussion here for some guidance. 

For context: I previously worked as a FICC trader and left to take a role in GRC because I needed a more stable position. My previous employer wasn't going to be able to keep me in that position for long, and I needed a stable income. I've been in my GRC position for over a year now. (Both of my roles have been at banks)

However, GRC is starting to feel like a dead end for me. I've been in charge of one of our audits, and the rest is basically internal assessments and dealing with vendors that do not send contracts for me to notify the regulator. I thought I just needed a paycheck and a 'slow-paced' environment (compared to a trading desk), and I would be good, but I'm starting to miss my old position a little too much.

The discussion I wanted to raise is, is it worth it to stay in GRC? Am I not seeing the bigger picture here? Because I miss having contact with clients, and right now, I'm only dealing with internal teams and the regulator. I have no regrets over what I’ve learned working in GRC (policies and regulations) but maybe it’s not the path for me.

Can someone who left GRC enlighten me a little? Or someone who stayed and had no regrets over it? I'm quite young, so I'm lacking guidance, and I’m trying to see the possibilities of what can I achieve staying in the area.","Is staying in GRC worth it?
Hi! I'm new to this community and I’m looking to open a little discussion here for some guidance. 

For context: I previously worked as a FICC trader and left to take a role in GRC because I needed a more stable position. My previous employer wasn't going to be able to keep me in that position for long, and I needed a stable income. I've been in my GRC position for over a year now. (Both of my roles have been at banks)

However, GRC is starting to feel like a dead end for me. I've been in charge of one of our audits, and the rest is basically internal assessments and dealing with vendors that do not send contracts for me to notify the regulator. I thought I just needed a paycheck and a 'slow-paced' environment (compared to a trading desk), and I would be good, but I'm starting to miss my old position a little too much.

The discussion I wanted to raise is, is it worth it to stay in GRC? Am I not seeing the bigger picture here? Because I miss having contact with clients, and right now, I'm only dealing with internal teams and the regulator. I have no regrets over what I’ve learned working in GRC (policies and regulations) but maybe it’s not the path for me.

* Commitment to maintain documentation with best security practices, current policies, and structure/framework that is already in place
* Work with leadership to provide transparency about what security is doing, our plans and other initiatives that will impact the business

I am at the pay ceiling of my current role and the pay increases are now only matching the inflation figures. 

I excel when it comes to designing solutions by looking at the bigger picture. My solution designing skills are excellent, however I am not the greatest coder. The day-to-day coding tasks have become boring and less interesting over the past few years (may be a result of looking at IDEs for nearly 20 years).

Cybersecurity and GRC have always been an area of interest to me and I have been involved in the cybersecurity discussions/initiatives in the company for the past 4-5 years (about 10-15% of my time). I have already acquired some cyber certifications such as ISC2 CC and OCEG GRCP as well.  

Though I am interested in cyber, I have no desire to sit behind SIEM logs or configure firewalls in a future role. My interest is in security policy and best practices, vulnerability management, server upgrades and patching, staff awareness, and training, etc and I do enjoy it when I get to work on those topics (or should I say ""participate in the discussions"" as I only attend the discussion phase and implementation is done by other teams) once in a while in my current role. I think in the long run this will lead me down the path to becoming a CISO one day.

Should I make the jump now and consider accepting a pay cut (10-15% of TRP ) to land a dedicated Cyber GRC analyst or Infosec audit role now or hang on there at my current role for another year or so and try to get a one or two higher valued Cybersecurity certification such as CISSP, CRISC, CISA or CISM under my belt and target a role that is equal or better in pay.

&#x200B;",should you consider taking a pay cut when changing careers from coding to non coding to open the path towards ciso i am a senior dev in my current role and have nearly    years of experience and make about    k plus super . the company that i work for has very little staff turnover due to great work life balance. there is a very low prospect of a promotion for me as people above me are highly unlikely to leave in the next couple of years due to the better pay and work life balance they enjoy. i am at the pay ceiling of my current role and the pay increases are now only matching the inflation figures. i excel when it comes to designing solutions by looking at the bigger picture. my solution designing skills are excellent however i am not the greatest coder. the day to day coding tasks have become boring and less interesting over the past few years . cybersecurity and grc have always been an area of interest to me and i have been involved in the cybersecurity discussions initiatives in the company for the past     years . i have already acquired some cyber certifications such as isc  cc and oceg grcp as well. though i am interested in cyber i have no desire to sit behind siem logs or configure firewalls in a future role. my interest is in security policy and best practices vulnerability management server upgrades and patching staff awareness and training etc and i do enjoy it when i get to work on those topics once in a while in my current role. i think in the long run this will lead me down the path to becoming a ciso one day. should i make the jump now and consider accepting a pay cut to land a dedicated cyber grc analyst or infosec audit role now or hang on there at my current role for another year or so and try to get a one or two higher valued cybersecurity certification such as cissp crisc cisa or cism under my belt and target a role that is equal or better in pay. x   b ps: on second thought should i consider moving on to a solution architect or similar role which involves less coding but not a drastic change as moving from development to infosec highly appreciate your input. x   b x   b,1,7,2424,2129,2024,1,Friday,22,/r/cybersecurity/comments/19aw49x/should_you_consider_taking_a_pay_cut_when/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/19aw49x/should_you_consider_taking_a_pay_cut_when/,1,0.5345882521273314,0.5345882521273314,SVM (Linear)

Hello everyone,

I trust this post finds you well. I'm currently navigating a unique situation in my career and could really use some guidance and advice.

For the past four years, I've been on a journey of self-learning and hands-on experience in various security domains, encompassing penetration testing to forensics among others. Over the last year, I've been part of a mid-sized company, and have been actively involved in IT operations and endpoint security. It's worth noting that this is my first job in security right out of the university and my entry into this role was facilitated by a family connection 

Also, my involvement in endpoint security started when I joined the company as there was no security department when I joined.

Recently, I undertook a project to establish a ""mini SOC"" within the company due to some concerning security issues. Our internal network lacks security measures, and we operate under a BYOD policy. During a sanctioned penetration test, I uncovered a significant vulnerability - our wireless Mikrotik router was accessible using default admin credentials, identical to our Wi-Fi password. This discovery was compounded by multiple brute force attempts originating from Russian and Chinese IP addresses.

Swiftly, I alerted the management, proposed security measures, and implemented vendor-specific suggestions for the router. Presently, I'm immersed in the setup of a SOC using open-source tools like Greylog, Wazuh, Grafana, theHive, MISP, and others. Currently, Greylog is successfully receiving logs from the router and other endpoint devices via Wazuh. I've also configured extractors in Greylog for more comprehensive log analysis.

My primary objective is to learn and acquire valuable experience through this project. However, I'm grappling with uncertainty regarding the marketability of my skills post-completion. Can I confidently expect that the skills honed in building this SOC will empower me to transition to a new job? If so, what additional skills should I concentrate on to bolster my marketability, and what specific job roles would you recommend I consider applying for?

I genuinely appreciate any advice, insights, or personal experiences you can share. Thank you in advance!","Seeking Advice on Transitioning Careers

I am 45 years old and have been a computer hobbyist since I was a kid. I have no formal training or past job experience in IT and have been out of the workforce for over ten years (taking care of my family).

I found out I was able to attend community college tuition-free through a program due to not having a degree. After looking through all the career path options available, I landed on cybersecurity. It seems the best fit for many reasons but what turned me on to it most was the job growth and median pay.    
  
So, I am now enrolled and just into my 3rd week of college, working on my associate degree with a major in cybersecurity. The community college I am going to has a specific program/career path for cybersecurity recognized by the NSA/Homeland Security and a dedicated simulation lab. I chose this college because they were the only one local that had those recognitions.    
  
I have read posts debating certs vs degrees and I am willing to get both. From what I see it seems like an associate degree + certs would be the best option for me. I am not sure exactly what area I will fall into as I am hoping through learning, I will find what works best for me but as of right now, I feel management would be the best place for me. So, for now, that is what is in my sight.  As a student, I have access to a couple of Coursera Google certs that I will get.  Google IT support and the Google Project management for sure but I was not sure if the data analytics would be worth it. I plan to also get ISC2 and Sec+ but I am not sure what else other than that I should focus on.    
  
I know this is going to be difficult, but I did think it would be easy to get a job right out of college.

I am prepared for a solid 2+ years of getting the knowledge and skills required to get into the field.

19d1hm0,cybersecurity,skylinesora,2024-01-22 17:46:36,1705945596,Tip To Reduce Burn Out,"As a cybersecurity analyst/professional, your job isn't to solely secure the business. It is to secure the business while still enabling it to operate. If the business chooses to accept a risk (whether it's big or small) and it's properly accepted (goes through all channels) and you in good faith do your best to advocate against it, then who cares?

If a risk gets accepted by upper management and you did a good job presenting your case, then obviously security isn't a major concern or the business values what can be gained by accepting the risk than what they lose by not accepting it.

In December I took a job in a completely unrelated field. The earnings are amazing and I genuinely like the culture, everyone is friendly and helpful, and I could see myself doing this until I retire. The only thing is, I’m not passionate at all about this job. Just the money. 

I just have a simple question—if you were in my shoes, what would you do? Would you continue to work this job and take advantage of the financial opportunity? Would you continue to indulge in your cyber passion on the side or as a hobby? 

Or would you quit this safe and lucrative job for the opportunity to get your foot in the door? 

I went to school for security, have been doing additional training and applying for jobs since early 2023. I got to the point where I was running out of money quickly and unable to pay my bills, so I had a good friend refer me to her company, and I got the job. Now that I took myself out of the infosec game suddenly the offers are coming in. 

I honestly don’t know what to do now.

If I decide to go with this infosec opportunity, after the internship/apprenticeship is over will I realistically be able to get a job in the industry with only two years of experience? 

Or should I just stay put since I’m safe here and making great money for the first time in my life. 

Frankly, I don’t know if I have the patience to grind it out for 5-10 more years until I’m able to make in cyber what I’m making right now in my current industry. 

I’m just very confused, to be honest. Please be gentle with me, not looking for any judgment, simply reaching out for some support.

I graduated from CC with an associates in cybersecurity 2022. While I was attending I landed an internship at a global cyber company as a technical licensing POC for a specific technology. This was May 2021 my internship was sent to end Aug 2021, but I was crushing it and they wanted to keep me on. They ended up extending me as an intern until I graduate.

While interning I was doing all customer facing work. Running projects by myself with all types of customers, anyone from fortune 100 to mom and pop shops.

Once I graduated the offered me a full time gig as a technical consultant for that technology. I was brought on as a Guinea pig (and told this) to see if I would be able to handle and succeed in the role, if not they would move me internally to something that was a better fit. They offered me 75k and a 5k sign on bonus. This being may 2022.

Well y’all I have been crushing it. I love the technology and we have some bleeding edge stuff and I am pretty damn sharp with it. So much so that I am a point of escalation for derailed projects to get them back on track and take on the difficult high visibility customers.

Looking for your input here:

I graduated from CC with an associates in cybersecurity 2022. While I was attending I landed an internship at a global cyber company as a technical licensing POC for a specific technology. This was May 2021 my internship was sent to end Aug 2021, but I was crushing it and they wanted to keep me on. They ended up extending me as an intern until I graduate.

While interning I was doing all customer facing work. Running projects by myself with all types of customers, anyone from fortune 100 to mom and pop shops.

Once I graduated the offered me a full time gig as a technical consultant for that technology. I was brought on as a Guinea pig (and told this) to see if I would be able to handle and succeed in the role, if not they would move me internally to something that was a better fit. They offered me 75k and a 5k sign on bonus. This being may 2022.

Well y’all I have been crushing it. I love the technology and we have some bleeding edge stuff and I am pretty damn sharp with it. So much so that I am a point of escalation for derailed projects to get them back on track and take on the difficult high visibility customers.

This is not a humble brag, I just really want to know if anyone has been here before.

At that MSP, I did everything I could get my hands on and I ended up being promoted into a security role internationally. I pivoted into a huge security firm shortly after.

I am doing great in my new role too. Already certing up, and branching out into the threat intel/purple teams, and getting my hands as dirty as I can. 1:1 meetings have been glowing so far. Meshing very well with my team.

My org is growing fast. Really, our client base is. We are doing very well, and we are busy.

1afg1g4,cybersecurity,GreenNine,2024-01-31 11:47:02,1706701622,SOC Analyst vs. IT Auditor for future career in vulnerability management.,"Hi everyone!

I have nearly two years of experience as a Tier 1 Engineer at an ISP (basic network support/help desk). Over the last year I've been studying and had several hands-on courses in networking, Windows and Linux system administration. I'm close to finishing the course for the eEDA certification from INE Security (formely eLearnSecurity).

My goal is to eventually work in vulnerability management (I am aware that I need a few years of experience + knowledge of different systems, networks, web apps + certifications) so I wanted to ask for your opinion on whether experience as a SOC analyst or IT auditor would be more suitable for the role (as these two are what I'm aiming for).

In the city I live, there are occasional openings for a Junior IT Auditor, as well as SOC Analysts.

I could apply for the auditor role after I've (hopefully) passed the eEDA, or I could continue with my other plan to finish several courses I have planned + the BTL1 and apply for a SOC role.

If working at a SOC did not include a rotation between day/nigh shifts, this would be a no-brainer, but I've no idea how this would impact my health. Lots of people say this is absolutely brutal, others aren't phased at all and actually love the schedule (2 days, 2 nights, 4 days). Burnout and alarm fatigue is also part of the picture, as I've read, but that I could live with. Not my first rodeo in that department.

TL;DR: For someone who wants to eventually work in Vulnerability Management, which of the two roles be a better fit: IT Auditor or SOC Analyst?  


PS: I've researched both roles quite a bit and the auditor one seems a lot less technical (at least the entry level one I'm looking at), but you seem to get some exposure to different systems/set ups, whereas in a SOC you can just be looking at alarms all day, or have many different duties, and everything in between. Out of all positions I've researched (e.g. security engineering, threat hunting, DFIR, pentesting, GRC, threat intel, etc.), vulnerability management is the one I'm most drawn to.","SOC Analyst vs. IT Auditor for future career in vulnerability management.

Out of all positions I've researched (e.g. security engineering, threat hunting, DFIR, pentesting, GRC, threat intel, etc.), vulnerability management is the one I'm most drawn to.",soc analyst vs. it auditor for future career in vulnerability management. hi everyone i have nearly two years of experience as a tier   engineer at an isp . over the last year i ve been studying and had several hands on courses in networking windows and linux system administration. i m close to finishing the course for the eeda certification from ine security . my goal is to eventually work in vulnerability management so i wanted to ask for your opinion on whether experience as a soc analyst or it auditor would be more suitable for the role . in the city i live there are occasional openings for a junior it auditor as well as soc analysts. i could apply for the auditor role after i ve passed the eeda or i could continue with my other plan to finish several courses i have planned the btl  and apply for a soc role. if working at a soc did not include a rotation between day nigh shifts this would be a no brainer but i ve no idea how this would impact my health. lots of people say this is absolutely brutal others aren t phased at all and actually love the schedule . burnout and alarm fatigue is also part of the picture as i ve read but that i could live with. not my first rodeo in that department. tl dr: for someone who wants to eventually work in vulnerability management which of the two roles be a better fit: it auditor or soc analyst ps: i ve researched both roles quite a bit and the auditor one seems a lot less technical but you seem to get some exposure to different systems set ups whereas in a soc you can just be looking at alarms all day or have many different duties and everything in between. out of all positions i ve researched vulnerability management is the one i m most drawn to.,7,18,2130,1714,2024,1,Wednesday,11,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1afg1g4/soc_analyst_vs_it_auditor_for_future_career_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1afg1g4/soc_analyst_vs_it_auditor_for_future_career_in/,1,0.7410232130168206,0.7410232130168206,SVM (Linear)

Next year I will be eligible to transition to the private sector and I am trying to better gauge what types of opportunities exist and whether they are worth me leaving the service just past the 5 year mark. If anyone has any perspective or even just general advice, I would definitely appreciate it. Thanks!

Background: I have a B.S. in CS and an M.S. in CS from a top 3 CS school. By the time I am able to get out, I will have roughly 3 years of practical experience, primarily leading and developing teams of defensive cyber analysts (analogous to security operations center analysts). Most of this work is not nearly as technical as my CS coursework, but is still rewarding nonetheless. Lots of projects, planning, briefing, and some hands-on time configuring SIEM dashboards, IDS rules, packet analysis, etc. Ultimately I enjoy being able to speak the technical details to the teams I manage while bridging the gap to more senior levels in the leadership chain.

If I did enter the private sector, one of my goals would be to earn my MBA and pursue the executive route.

Questions:

1. What private sector careers emphasize a CS background but would allow me to develop my leadership and allow a more business oriented focus? Anything outside of SWE or security engineering roles?
2. Do companies value military cyber experience, in other words, to what extent would I be “starting over” and how much of my experience would likely translate?
3. What is a realistic salary/total compensation expectation? (I realize this is dependent on many factors)
4. Anyone have knowledge of companies that sponsor an MBA? (Staying in the military longer would grant me the GI Bill to pay for my MBA)
5. Anything I should accomplish in the service before looking to get out? (Studying for CISSP currently)","Opportunities outside of military?

Currently studying for Azure SC-200 in the hopes it’ll help me progress as Sentinel/Defender is heavily used in the soc. Have the google cyber cert and AWS SAA currently. Thinking after SC-200 then security+ would probably make sense.


Any words of advice for areas to focus on? Things you wish you knew at the beginning? Anything like that?

I read this post below awhile back and only do a small portion of the main, reoccurring items.  Job posting and reality have been a bit of a bait and switch.

&#x200B;

Throwaway account due to the questions..

I have just received an offer to join the falcon team and I'm a bit thorn if I should leap at the opportunity or not.

&#x200B;

As it stands I'm at a cushy job as a security engineer with analyst capabilities for a small team.

What is the workload like? I have heard of horror stories from MSPs and frankly, I do not want to spend 11 hours a day on full alert mode. Does anyone have any insights into this? Is the team expected to work at burn out rates or is it better than standard MSP considering the number of analysts in the team.

Heard some mixed reviews about working for them - any insights?  


What is it like progression wise? - keep reading online that after a year you can move to a different team within the company.

&#x200B;

Lastly, how much of an impact would it have on my career to go ""backwards"" from engineer to analyst?  


  
Thank you

A little background about me, I just moved here recently in Canada as a PR. So I had to leave my studies in my last country. I was a student of BS Computer Science back then, I’m on my 3rd semester as a full time student there.

What Im considering now is if I should continue my BSCS degree or not. There’s a chance that my units can be recognized as a transfer student, if it gets recognized I’m just afraid of the different curriculum and I wont be starting off as a first year. If it doesn’t get recognized I will be starting again as a first year again which I feel it’s a waste since I’m starting over again. 

The cons are the price for the tuition, I’m not confident  to take academic scholarships since I might not be able to retain it high since I might be working to sustain my fees and I’m not that much of the creative outside of the box thinker. The pros are it has more opportunities in the future and definitely explores a lot more areas. Also it’s a bachelor’s degree.

The other thing I’m considering is should take a 2 year program here as a Network Administrator in a Community College then taking a Cybersecurity program after. Since Cybersecurity in the cc near me requires a post secondary degree of network administrator or other IT equivalent diploma. What I like about this one is I think it matches my personality more since I’m not typically best at programming since I’m not the usual outside of the box creative thinker. 

Pros are it matches my personality more and cheaper than university. Also I’m interested in going on the cybersecurity side. Cons are idk about the future growth opportunities.","Need for advices for my post secondary education

Created standard query and table formats to effectively reuse queries. (Mimicking Log Analytics/Sentinel tables to ADX using log aggregation tool I developed to parse/filter)

Designed and developed a tool to detect and alert if IaC scanning is implemented across all ADO pipelines.

Redesigned and implemented our entire azure virtual desktop infrastructure.

Designed and implement our entire AWS security. (There was no security on AWS so I implemented it all when I first started - no alerting or logging etc)

I'm an 18yrs old recent high school grad and have been involved with Infosec for about a year because of my interest in computers. It's my passion to pursue it because I enjoy it TBH. My yearly goal is to get certs liks OSCP and CPTS this year. But these things don't come cheap and the situation becomes even worse considering I belong to an underdeveloped country and not a good financial background.  


While I love going to THM and HTB doing their free rooms I have to balance that with some earning so I could afford at-least their premium training plans for learning. Their international pricing makes it very hard to afford here ($10-$20 per month doesn't make sense here). To deal with this, I've been learning basic web-dev so I could use that to do freelance work and earn until I break into Infosec (which I know isn't easy) but I'm not sure if people would be comfortable giving me work on those platforms due to my lack of experience. In addition to that, I am somewhat comfortable with linux command line since I've been using it for about 2 years as my main OS , so basic sysadmin work doesn't seem too daunting to me.  


Long story short, I wanted to ask this community what skills that aren't completely different from Infosec/IT would you guys recommend to focus on to earn in the short-term like should I continue learning web-dev or do I need to get into some other skill like sysadmin stuff etc? Also if you guys have some experience or advice to share on some similar situation, It'd be really helpful for me.","Earning while learning Infosec as a young lad

I also was the first GRC analyst on the team (I had no prior experience except for a few months in the SOC - more on that in a minute), so I don’t really have very much guidance and basically have to figure everything out myself.

It seems the Navy is making a cyber transition but the competitive nature of the Air Force for cyber is very daunting (only commission through the CDCP)? I would also miss out on the non-rated board in May, which is all that seems to be posted for this year so far.

To add to this, I want to make sure that I get the best opportunities for professional development, particularly though certifications, masters, etc. Based on some of my background, goals, and timeline, do you guys think it'd be worth waiting for the Air Force or is the Navy also a good option for cyber?

I personally am very invested in serving as soon as possible after I graduate, but I do want to leverage my education as much as possible through pursuing a career in cyber (overseeing networks/communications would be my top interest). It seems the Navy is making a cyber transition but the competitive nature of the Air Force for cyber is very daunting (only commission through the CDCP)? I would also miss out on the non-rated board in May, which is all that seems to be posted for this year so far.

To add to this, I want to make sure that I get the best opportunities for professional development, particularly though certifications, masters, etc. Based on some of my background, goals, and timeline, do you guys think it'd be worth waiting for the Air Force or is the Navy also a good option for cyber?

I‘m 20 years old and currently an Cyber Security Analyst Tier 2. Working in switzerland. Education: Apprenticeship in part of plattform engineering in switzerland.

I have been working in different SOCs for about 4 years.

2 of those years (year 3&4 of the apprenticeship) I have been working during my apprenticeship in an internal SOC. Afterwards I stayed for one year as a detection engineer. Then I switched to a MSS Provider in switzerland. Couple of times I have been working on Incident response cases.

I applied out of curiosity for some other jobs and received two very interesting offers. I‘m a little bit unsure what I should choose. But I want to switch definitely.

First role: Cyber Security Engineer - A company that is a critical infrastructure provider and is currently building up an own internal SOC. 40 % more than my current salary and in my opinion a very interesting role. Because I could build up everything from scratch. Means like every Security (technical) question would go over my desk. Team size would be about 4-5 people. But for some year, probably 2, I would go completely away from normal incident handling and get in the engineering side. Afterwards I would probably switch back to Security Operations.

Second role: Smaller company specializing in Endpoint Monitoring. Role as an Incident Reponder. 25% more salary and also building up an Incident Response team to extend the offering of the company. Initial team size would be 3 and they want to extend to 6 people this year. Very interesting from a perspective to get more into Incident Response and actually specializing me even more in Cyber Operations.

Paid Certifications and other benefits are quite equal. Not that a lot of a benefit to say tjat company X is more attractive from a fringe benefit side.

I‘m kind of confused woth what I should go. But both roles are very interesting. What is your opinion on those roles guys?","What should I choose?

Although I have a BA in the arts, I decided to go to a six month bootcamp that my job paid for at a university to gain a certificate. Prior to gaining my cert, I noticed on online discussions how so many people were having trouble with getting into positions even with BS', and other certs. There was so much discourse that I honestly was skeptical anything would come from my cert.

Well, after my cert, I met a woman in the tech dept of my job and she offered to have me shadow her in her role. When getting to know her, I learned she had zero experience prior and she didn't even have a college education. After shadowing with her for six months, she introduced me to the security director of the cyber defense dept. He too started out with zero experience, a BA, and was actually in the treasury department prior to him getting his first CS role. This director told me he wanted me to shadow as a SOC and he set me up with two people on his team.

Upon shadowing these two, I learned one was a college drop out although he did end up getting a cert. He got the role simply because he knew someone in the department and they were looking for someone to fill the role. The other one, similar thing but she had a BA. 

Through these four people, I've been able to converse with more people and more people even outside of the company from other companies and they all have similar stories.

I am removing the post for professional and personal reasons. I do appreciate the replies, offers, and posts. After careful consideration and after reading several snide and rude comments, I've decided I'm just going to venture out into a different endeavor.

I received some very nice thoughts, even some offers of work. But, after being insulted here and looking at my last job, I really don't think, IT or Cybersec are right for me. I have other options and I'm going to explore them.

Interest in a profession doesn't assure success. And my personality doesn't jive with a lot of the negativity. Honestly, I'm glad I'm retired, but I miss the fire department and blue collar work. It's a more supportive environment. Honestly, some of the DMs were pretty insulting. And I'm of a group of men that wouldn't take kindly to some of the crap ya'll say. Face it, you wouldn't say it if we were standing eye-to-eye. So, why here?

Lot of anger out there in the corporate world. Doesn't matter your politics, gender, sex, ethnicity. A lot of anger. And just don't want that in my life. I shared something and was probably wrong to do so. If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, I hope you don't compromise your principles folks. It's not worth it. No amount of cash is worth that.

Don't get me wrong a lot of kind folks here. But this thread just edged the scales away from the vocation of cybersecurity.

TLDR: Folks who leveled a volley of insults-GFY. The polite kind folks, thanks. ***In short, I'd rather turn tricks in a truck stop parking lot than work with some of you***. By the way, I used the idiom 'brass tacks' accurately. Don't worry. You won't have any additional competition for these 'coveted roles' (as one DM put it). Personally, I hope some of you a-holes find yourselves where you belong. Good day, folks. ","Fired a couple of months ago. Found out why and I'm very PO'd!

And it got me thinking:  the older one gets, the harder it is to keep up with the evolving threat landscapes, regulatory changes, business operating environments, budget and staff cuts and many other things that really impact how a business manages their IT Security.  

For those who are young and starting out, maybe this is not a big deal and such persons are likely to be able to land on their feet should they take a fall.  Such persons are likely to pick up new skills faster and be more employable.

But for those who have been in the field in one way or another for like 20+ years are probably in their mid 40's/early 50's now - basically too old (and expensive) to get decent employment elsewhere, too young to qualify for retirement, and probably peaked career and salary-wise.  So if the burnout hits, it can hit hard and fast when you have likely have hit a brick wall but in denial.  

Also at this 45-55 age range, people have family commitments, significant financial obligations and cannot just head for the exit like that.  On the flip side if they are asked to leave from their current roles, they may not be able to sort out a plan B in a timely manner - so really a double whammy.

Furthermore, when I see yesterday's announcement of Palo Alto forecasting lower future earnings, despite heightend cyber risk (sending their stock prices lower by like 20% on the day), it further suggests that businesses everywhere are cutting their cyber-spend and taking on higher tolerances (sacrifices) on cyber risk.  This basically translates into budget/staff cuts, lower investments in tech and hiring freezes.  

So the wider industry is somewhat in pain.  And this pain may be felt by the more senior folks (they're senior, but too young to be boomers!) in this field than the young and upcomers.

So I wanted to start a discussion if there are persons here who think of leaving the field altogether and do something else?  Do you have an exit strategy in mind?  What would you leave a decent paying cyber role for? Would you perhaps use your experience to stay in cyber but work as a freelancer?

I recently left a senior cyber position at a multinational to start my own physical commodity trading firm (mainly agricultural staples, edible oils and such).  Totallly unrelated field and it makes less money, but I'm happier at least.  I've certainly learned more about how the world operates and got a better grasp on global geopolitics and macroeconomics through this than I ever have through all my years as a corporate drone at least!

b) if this is really a normal thing, does it still pay to be in security architecture/eng? or would it be better just to move to SOC?

The position in question is a security analyst position, a position I have been trying to get for a few years now.

I have a security+ certification,  a B.S in Cybersecurity, and several years of IT experience ranging from Network troubleshooting, debugging, tech support, sys admin - to working for AWS as a cloud support engineer.

After reading some advice on this subreddit I decided to build my own homelab server where I got direct experience setting up subnets and VLANs and creating a DMZ for devices that are going to be Internet facing, setting up wire guard for VPN access, managing my own DNS server, setting up DNS over TSL, setting up a CA for https certificates, and I've even setup Elasticsearch + Kabana (ELK stack) so I can hit that SIEM qualification.

The job itself I feel very much like I would be a perfect fit, but when they were asking me about enterprise EDRs or MDRs I had to tell them I did not have experience with that, and to be honest I blanked out on what they even were and I feel like this where is screwed up. I know about Crowdstrike but that's really it. I also only have a little bit of cybersecurity experience, mainly being working on SOC 2 compliance, user access control auditing, risk management committee at my company, and basic security training for employees.

Anywho I am feeling discouraged at the moment. Its been tough trying to get into this field and I feel like there is more I could be doing to help myself out, but besides getting more certs ( I plan on getting the CCNA next month and then the Cysa+ soon after) how can I make someone take a chance with me if I don't have a whole lot of cybersecurity specific experience? Also, is there any MDRs or EDRs tools that anyone recommends that are open source/ would be good to play around with in my homelab?

Overall the HR person told me they would pass my resume along to the hiring manager, and that although they are leaning more towards a candidate with enterprise experience with those tools, they are also interested in my cloud experience at AWS. If I do end up with another interview is there anything specific I should brush up as far as cloud security side of things, like must knows? My only experience security wise with AWS is AWS inspector and I guess IAM if one would consider that as security.

This would be a dream Job for me and if I get a second interview I want to make sure I'm prepared, so any advice would be greatly appreciated!","Security Analyst interview did not go very well today, advice appreciated

- I got my start at a tech startup and moved on to other local companies.
- I've always enjoyed and focused on the device management side.
- Currently, I'm the Intune/O365 SME at a financial organization. I was hired to implement CIS benchmarks and work with cybersecurity to remediate and patch vulnerabilities on user endpoints. I'm enjoying the work and I'm learning a lot.
- However, I want to move to the US and work at a FAANG. I'm a US citizen, so moving isn't the issue.
- I feel a bit insecure as I have a unrelated degree and a one-year certificate program in IT at a local community college.
- A former coworker at the tech startup (unrelated degree, like me) got promoted to a junior cybersecurity role, and then moved to a tech unicorn in the States. He works remotely, but the company is paying for his relocation to San Jose. I make about 80K CAD with a defined benefit pension, while my friend earns 200K CAD. 
- He told me he got a Master's in Cybersecurity from the SANS Institute. 
- I'm interested in getting the Master's degree (from SANS or Georgia Tech) as I feel it will ""rubber stamp"" my skillset and it will allow me to be competitive to FAANG companies.
- Sorry for the rambling. I feel a bit insecure and out of my depth, but I do know that I can learn and I'm good at asking questions if I don't know something, and I can break down complicated concepts into simple terms anyone can understand.
- This is the Master's degree my friend got https://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-masters/1/ 
- Will this degree be a worthwhile investment? I feel when this degree is paired with my current role, it should be enough to get me at least a junior role at a FAANG, or am I being overambitious?

Anyways, the analyst position is new to the organization. I met the I.T manager on my first day, he showed me some things and granted me access to our phishing filter and employee training system. That was a week ago, as he left for surgery and won't be back until next week.

....I have no idea what to do with myself....

The first day I taught myself the aforementioned product. Since there I have familiarized myself with every policy, plan, framework, and whatnot. We're talking eight hours a day of studying and processing the information on how it can be applied. Hell I even wrote a policy draft, accompanied with research that was listed to be done on the strategy plan. I'm sitting here now at the office with no idea what to do.

I asked the CIO last week about how he would like me to proceed. He said I am in the discovery phase and should be looking around their systems. Problem being, I don't have that level of access yet. I barely have any access as the I.T manager is to grant me it. I have documentation of the systems we use, but not even the access to look at them.  I've asked the system and network admins to see if I can be granted access and basically I have to wait for  the manager to come back.

My Timeline

- Started as CTF player in 2016 
- Made into Bugbounties from 2017 
- Made enough money and quit bugbounty in 2021 to learn something new 
- In 2021, Joined a fintech company based in pune as a Senior Analyst and started managing bugbounty management.. Like onboarding applications, Budget allocation kind of program management role 
- Unfortunately it didn't last long... Due to family problem where I was in the situation I need to quit because I need to travel around 2,000 kms every week to take care of my parents as I was leaving away from them
- Immediately and blindly joined this SaaS company based in Chennai... Now part of AppSec team 


Problems that I'm facing 

- After joining the SaaS Company, again started in VAPT role... Nowadays I literally hate this alot especially doing the same stuff again and again...I really loved doing job in fintech Company because of new role and new responsibilities 
- After joining the SaaS Company, analysed their security posture gave them ideas on improving the security posture...Because the posture is really bad and Made a presentation... Discussed for 2 hrs and at the end of meeting... They told it won't work out and improvement idea which I made it was based on SaaS security posture
- So, eventually I left the idea and Made a decision that we have a bounty program... So left the pentest on web, APIs, Mobile behind and started focusing on new things which I didn't learn or experience in the past.. Chosen cloud native security part to start out with Kubernetes and Docker pentesting...Learned it and management told to focus on the VAPT... It really sucks 


Sometimes the people talk behind my back... Which is obviously hurt my feelings and can't focus on my tasks or even learning... Kind of become monkey minded person...

- Unfortunately it didn't last long... Due to family problem where I was in the situation I need to quit because I need to travel around 2,000 kms every week to take care of my parents as I was leaving away from them
- Immediately and blindly joined this SaaS company based in Chennai... Now part of AppSec team 


Problems that I'm facing 

- After joining the SaaS Company, again started in VAPT role... Nowadays I literally hate this alot especially doing the same stuff again and again...I really loved doing job in fintech Company because of new role and new responsibilities 
- After joining the SaaS Company, analysed their security posture gave them ideas on improving the security posture...Because the posture is really bad and Made a presentation... Discussed for 2 hrs and at the end of meeting... They told it won't work out and improvement idea which I made it was based on SaaS security posture
- So, eventually I left the idea and Made a decision that we have a bounty program... So left the pentest on web, APIs, Mobile behind and started focusing on new things which I didn't learn or experience in the past.. Chosen cloud native security part to start out with Kubernetes and Docker pentesting...Learned it and management told to focus on the VAPT... It really sucks 


Sometimes the people talk behind my back... Which is obviously hurt my feelings and can't focus on my tasks or even learning... Kind of become monkey minded person...

Imo, it's a dream I've had for a long time. I'm a systems networker, by trade - only really working on Cisco Routers/Switches, basically campus topologies - and not at all on the enterprise side. 

With that in mind, as well as the amount of money they said they'll throw at me... they didn't say that they'll throw in ""Imposter Syndrome"" as a signing bonus. But I got that in full.

Anyways, I'm getting over it, and there was one simple thing I did...

*I watched Kung-Fu Panda.*

I swear, that movie expresses imposter syndrome in such a beautiful way. Jack Black spoke to me on some type of level that really made me realize that the seat I'm sitting in, isn't an accident. I worked hard at it. I've been working with Linux since I was 12 (albeit the reason being: windows bricked my drive and I moved over out of necessity... not out of passion - and I learned to love it, like Stockholm syndrome probably). But I continued working at it. I just finished my BS Cyber Degree (which I think should be a fake degree - but DoDD 8140 likes it) and I got credentialed in Sec+, CCNA, and CISSP. There was just one thing I lacked... 

Po found it when he read the dragon warrior man-page. *Self-confidence.* I took those certs because I needed a third-party to tell me I was qualified, and I still didn't believe it. 

*You can pass a million IT certs, but if you don't believe you're in the role you're in right now, then nobody can tell you you're qualified until you believe in yourself.*

I always did what society asked of me. I finished school with 2 degrees (aa in comp. Info. Systems. Bachelors in cyber security). I got a handful of major certs: sec+, cysa+, BTL1, CISSP, and CCNA to name a few. I have an IQ of 128. I have no diagnosed mental illnesses but I do suffer from major chronic pain that makes getting into an office pure hell.

I've been an analyst, auditor, grc architect, and currently am a L2 security engineer for a major corporation.

I've never felt in control no matter what I did. Every job I held I felt complete and utter burnout with the exception of the grc role which I actually loved and it was fully remote paying 140k (budget cut layoffs managed to ruin that which happens ALL THE TIME in tech). I feel like it's impossible in current day market to land another remote grc role again. I paid for premium linkedin and I apply until my fingers bleed every day. Dice. Zip recruiter. You name it. I'm using it.

With my current role I go home every day depressed and anxious and embarrassed that I just can't hack it (no pun intended). Working in infosec feels like an impossible game of tetris. The blocks just keep falling rapidly and you are just killing yourself trying to keep up.

I'm so tired...I'm in my 5th year of cyber security and I don't know how much longer I can hang on. I even told my boss idk what I'm doing or if this is even for me. I was hoping he would let me go right there but he didn't. 

I guess what I'm wondering is what should I consider if I'm done with cyber security? Has anyone here went on to do something that isn't so unfair and constantly demanding? I mean I am growing white hairs and have very dark thoughts that i wont get into but you can figure it out. I now take anti anxiety medication as well as pain killers just to get through the day. this engineering role is also on-site every single day which makes it even worse for my chronic pain. I feel defeated...

I feel like I'd be happier with a simple mindless job like being a bartender or a waiter...I feel like I should just be a janitor like Good Will Hunting...smart kid that just cleans toilets...just throw it all away because maybe then I'll finally be happy and content...I'll have a basic job that I can actually do well and when i go home I can enjoy some video games and relax like a normal nerd would...

Idk where I'm going with this but I just feel terrible and was hoping maybe someone might have something positive to tell me...maybe some advice or insight of some kind...am i the only one thats like this? Is something just wrong with me?

Anyways...thanks for reading and godspeed 🙏 ❤️ ","Quitting cybersecurity

But as the title states ive reached my limit with the industry, to preface, graduated university in 2019 and managed to land a security engineering role before i had my graduation ceremony, it was a dream come true at the time.

Stayed there for 2 years learning and really loving the people i was meeting and what i thought was meaningful work protecting the world. I felt like i was learning a lot and the work challenged me enough that it kept it entertaining. I then moved to a much larger consultancy and into a more senior role as a consultant in devsecops, realised the role was way to senior for me after a ton of stress and pressure and left to another security engineering role but this time for an internal role at what i later found out to be a grey market gambling organization. At the time it was very little work but the notion of doing something that i enjoy or like really took a toll on me as i hated the organisation and what it did. The team i worked silo'ed itself off due to politics and i was one of 2 engineers running the entire security tooling and supporting the different BU's in their project work. I had little to no support and was told so many lie during the interview its a joke to think about it now.  So i thought let me go back into consultancy as a consultant at a smaller boutique place, maybe that will do it.

My god how i was wrong, this role was undersold to me and now im doing the role of a techincal lead, project manager and engineer right from day 1. The organization is so immature that theres no documentation theres no process and theres no accountability and again there is almost 0 support. 

I've come to my wits end now, the industry is such a toxic place with such little support and I just want out. The money has been great but at the cost of my mental and physical wellbeing, every single day i dread turning on my laptop and everyday its 100% pressure all day every day.

Im considering going into contracting but thats just the same place with a different shade of shit and altogether just leaving cyber security as a whole and go into a different industry altogether.

I started only as a ISO 27001 Auditor, then jumped in my actual position, but now that I understand the whole surface stuff, is hard to pick a path, like Pentesting is cool, knowing SOC is cool, Forensics is cool, GRC is cool, everything is so fucking good and cool that I am not focusing in one stuff. 

My final goal is to be a VCISO, CISO or CIO, then after a few years, just quit everything and open a coffee shop (weird right?), still the starting point which I feel I am at the moment, is pretty mess, should I focus only in compliance stuff? Should I focus on technical stuff? Should I focus on soft skills to deal with people? Smh...

At the moment I have some certifications of TryHackMe, developing certs, taking my Master's Degree in Information Security, some other lower courses sites... But I don't know if it's enough as I see everyone have the ISC2 certifications, ISACA certifications, Cloud certifications (Azure, Google, AWS), etc... Kinda feel I don't know anything even if I have studied quite a lot hahah. 

So yeah, if you guys have some tips, or felt the same at some point, please share it so at least I feel I am not the only dummy here hehe 

Love ya all ","Asking for guidance my cybersecurity pals

Obviously nothing “net new” in terms of have hobbies, hit the gym etc. Of course it all makes sense, and I 100% agree.

What gets me at my current job is that everybody, coworkers, mgmt, leadership, all of them talk up a storm about how important security is, and at the same time really don’t give a shit, as soon as they actually have to do something about it.

Idk- I think I need to switch to consulting or something. Then I could literally not give a shit about the outcome and get paid nicely.

Here, it’s like - I’m better off shutting my mouth and don’t rock the boat. But lord have mercy if something would happen that I would have known about and wouldn’t have pushed it.

Constant CYA mode and feeling like I have to pretend to care while nobody else does- I think that is what grinds me down the most.

Twofaced hypocritical BS.

Personal support in a different sense lol.

Decades ago, when I started out, I’ve heard that professionals in IT security burn out after about 10 years.  I’ve been in the field for 25 years. I think there needs to be different severity levels of burnout. 

If I could quit working altogether,  I would walk away, and never look back.

Sages, gurus and veterans of the field, how do you deal with the fact that nobody, including management, CISOs,  friends, coworkers, literally anybody in your life do not care about the job you do, as long as you don’t cause them any more work, as long as you don’t make them feel bad in any way, shape or form (unintentionally, just by nature of your profession), that you’re just a risk documenter, resource unit, warm body, a cog in the wheel of compliance, etc?

And don’t tell me that you like the pay (same), “it is what it is”, “nothing I can do”, etc. how do you actually manage to compartmentalize?

How do you keep away your frustration and disappointment from your significant others, families, etc.?

What hobbies do you have to help you cope?

I’ve picked up a number of them in the past few years, but I sometimes have a hard time even focusing on them, because sometimes my doubts in my purpose in this field are really strong, and distract me from being able to focus on other things. 

The fact that literally nobody cares whatsoever, I am mostly used to it, but sometimes it really gets to me.

Thanks.

I've been working as a SOC Tier 1 Analyst since Sept 2023, and my plan was to start a master's program in Sept 2024, which would take two years to complete. Additionally, I wanted a promotion to Tier 2 Analyst on the short termZ

However i recently had a discussion with my manager about pursuing my master's and seeking a promotion to Tier 2. However, the situation isn't as straightforward as I hoped.

As with many SOC analysts, my schedule involves 24/7 shifts, which is gonna make it challenging to find the right time for the master's program. The company won't cover the cost of the master's since my manager considers it not directly related to the SOC. It is a cybersecurity master tho, focusing on concepts such as incident response, risk management, malware analysis, and network security. My manager emphasizes focusing on courses related to our tooling, which I understand, but feel like he has a bit biased towards masters.

When I asked about my goal to promote to Tier 2, I was told it's too early to discuss. He acknowledged my performance but remained vague about the timeline. I suspect it might take at least a year, which seems like a stretch as my Tier 1 job is becoming easier, and I'm unsure how long I can sustain it. Luckily, there's a thin line between Tier 1 and Tier 2, as we can also improve rules, go hunting, etc., but I wanted Tier 2 for its 9-5 schedule, which would also benefit my master's with a more ""normal"" schedule.

Feeling a bit disappointed and unsure of my next steps, I would appreciate any insights or advice you all might have. How should I navigate this situation? Has anyone faced a similar scenario, and if so, what decisions did you make? Looking forward to your thoughts and experiences. Thanks!","Need your guys advice….

My issue with burnout articles is they tend to offer vague suggestions and end with a sales pitch. Honestly the key is in the Serenity Prayer: accept the things you cannot change, be brave enough to change what you can, and be wise enough to know the difference.

Start with Root Cause: Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, and Greater Good say the top causes of burnout are:  
·       Perceived lack of control  
·       Lack of clear expectations of you or the role  
·       Heavy workloads/Unreasonable deadlines  
·       Poor relationships/Lack of support/Unfair treatment  
·       Problems with work-life balance  
  
I will add ""A persistent stream of negativity"" to the pile.  
  
The good news is it can be manageable if we (and our leaders) are open, alert, and supportive. The bad news is you need to do much of the work yourself.

Iv been in cybersecurity 6.5 years now have had multiple roles and generally very very happy with the line of work. 

BUT I am starting to feel I would just want a job where I can go do what I need to do and go home. The nature of the field of work is very fast paced meaning the constant upkeep in news , threats , vulnerabilities and general information sometimes gets a bit much ! 

And the constant need to up skill is a killer sometimes when you just want to work away for a while if life is super busy outside work. 

For context I got my degree in cybersecurity nearly 7 years ago. Since then I feel like it’s been nonstop and a bit of a pressure cooker since then. 

Granted maybe I need a new role with a different company that has more of a balance. 

But can’t help feel I’d love to just have a job and go home and not worry about anything in between. 


If and when you have felt like this what steps did you take to shake it up and help ?

Since the age of 18, I've been dedicated to pursuing a career in cybersecurity. I entered the field in under three years, which involved many late nights and work weeks exceeding 60 hours. Without being overly dramatic, I've encountered quite a bit during those years. At one point, I was a senior SOC analyst and excelled in my role. I found joy in my job and the work I performed, feeling that I was making a real difference. I was not only assisting other analysts but also involved in training and hiring new team members. In an attempt to shield them from burnout, I took on an excessive workload myself—a decision that was, in hindsight, quite detrimental. Consequently, I experienced burnout, and unexpectedly, my actions conveyed a lack of trust towards my team. Following this, I sought an administrative role and was eventually let go from the company after about a year.  
Fortunately, due to my extensive network, I secured a new position as a security engineer within a few weeks. However, I struggle to find my rhythm again. Everything seems futile; I feel ensnared in an endless cycle of monotony. The betrayal by individuals I considered friends at my previous company weighs heavily on me.

I’ve been working in the cyber industry for 4 years now, having previously been in aircraft maintenance and then systems engineering. 

When I switched roles over to becoming a cyber analyst for my organisation, there was the lure of training for someone of my skill base in cyber. That being essentially none. 
Due to whatever reasons that happened in the business, that funding stream dried up very quickly, and since then I’ve had no formal training courses. 

My experience was deeply rooted in the GRC space, but have since transitioned out of that into a Cyber Enabler/Integration role. 

I have now finally been given the green light by my manager to “do whatever training you feel as you have earned it”. 

I view my career pathway heading towards the management/leadership direction, and as such I aim to gain CISSP and/or CISM certification once I meet the experience requirements. 

So my question is, what training would people recommend I look at?

&#x200B;

Hello gentleman,

I'm about to interview  for a security ops manager, where the responsibilities are leading a small team, leading incident response, endpoint security, dlp, logging, identifying security gaps and coverage gaps, maintaining the operation and documentation for the security tools, etc. 

Background:  11+ years of experience; half of it spent in Big4 doing IT risk audits. The rest are in GRC. Current responsibilities include risk assessments, technical controls review, designing and collecting security metrics, reporting, drafting requirements for how controls should be implemented on the audit issues or those from my assessments. I have my cissp and gcih and some other 'soft certs' from isaca. I don't directly manage people, though I work with lots of counterparties, but I had direct people experience in my prior role. 

I feel like I have the right experience to build and lead the secops and sec engineering processes, and the team. Where I feel I'm lagging is that I never had the direct hands-on experience myself (ie I never implemented security tools myself, I never had to be hands down and respond to an incident myself), but I understand those processes, I took few courses (ie the GCIH, the BLT1).

Any tips on how to prepare, how to present myself, and what a CISO might look for in the interview? 

Thank you,

Now it's just emails, meetings, phone calls, manager speak (circling back, partnering, running things down, closing the loop), instilling hope while managing expectations with employees, having tough conversations when I could care less, and just no time behind a system.

My issue isn't with my direct reports, the programs I interface with, or the day to day monotony of being a paper pusher. It's with my peers and superiors. They say FOSS is bad, I rebuke, they burn me at the stake - they say we should focus on overall SCAP/Stig score, I say that's a piss poor metric for security, they plunge me in the water.

Started working in August last year at a company where I only do black/grey box application security penetration testing.

Pros: Not very stressful, likable and knowledgeable colleagues, no customer meetings, relatively stable company in general, good health allowance policy etc… Feel like i’m always able to learn in this environment.

Cons: Salary (€31k) with almost no room for negotiation, Remote/hybrid-remote out of the picture for at least 6 months from now

Recently got a job offer to start working for another, a lot smaller company. I would do consulting here, which includes a lot more than just application security. However, around 80% of what I actually would do will be application security pentesting just as now. But I will need to do *some* mobile and more traditional network pen testing every now and then as well, along with other misc things that encompasses cloud / forensics etc…

Pros: Salary (€44k)!!! with a lot higher yearly increase, Full-time remote but may need to be on-site 2-3 times a year.

Cons: Probably a lot more stressful since the role is a lot broader and I can get assigned a wide variety of tasks. Probably only surface-level connection with colleagues. No real seniors I can ask for help. Way smaller company than now so risk for being let go due to a variety of reasons  increases a lot.

I'm bored out of my mind. Every day is a slog to get through.

Sure there are moments where things get exciting and I feel like I have to actually think, but those are few and far between.

I'm going to be getting my computer science degree at the end of the year and am strongly considering dipping out once that happens and going to dev work.

So I suppose people can take this as a warning that cyber isn't nearly as sexy as it appears. Or maybe it just wasn't for me. 

I'm thinking of moving onto the dev world and keeping cyber as a hobby (you know doing ctfs and such cause that's fun).

I want to hear from your guys experience what has worked or not worked.

For context, we are 400ish employees operating critical infrastructure. Our current model is junior, mid-tier and senior analysts. The junior and mid tier are honestly very similar both doing initial triage of siem alerts, vuln management, and threat hunting. Senior is more on detecting engineering, playbook development, IR escalations, etc. Dedicated two person team for cyber threat intelligence.

We don't really have the budget to build out specific teams for each function like detection engineering, vuln management, etc. We are limited to about 6-8 analysts, operating 8-5 and 24/7 oncall.

I think this model could use some work and I've been reading into more tiered SOCs a lot recently and clearly defining what each tier is doing and their responsibilities. If anyone has advice or experiences would love to hear it.

Senior is more on detecting engineering, playbook development, IR escalations, etc. Dedicated two person team for cyber threat intelligence.

We don't really have the budget to build out specific teams for each function like detection engineering, vuln management, etc. We are limited to about 6-8 analysts, operating 8-5 and 24/7 oncall.

I think this model could use some work and I've been reading into more tiered SOCs a lot recently and clearly defining what each tier is doing and their responsibilities. If anyone has advice or experiences would love to hear it.

Thanks!",soc operating models so my organization is going under a lot of change currently and i have the opportunity to redesign how the soc operates at an organization level. i want to hear from your guys experience what has worked or not worked. for context we are    ish employees operating critical infrastructure. our current model is junior mid tier and senior analysts. the junior and mid tier are honestly very similar both doing initial triage of siem alerts vuln management and threat hunting. senior is more on detecting engineering playbook development ir escalations etc. dedicated two person team for cyber threat intelligence. we don t really have the budget to build out specific teams for each function like detection engineering vuln management etc. we are limited to about     analysts operating     and      oncall. i think this model could use some work and i ve been reading into more tiered socs a lot recently and clearly defining what each tier is doing and their responsibilities. if anyone has advice or experiences would love to hear it. thanks,7,6,1078,1063,2024,4,Wednesday,20,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1bv399w/soc_operating_models/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1bv399w/soc_operating_models/,1,0.37268492592065916,0.6273150740793408,SVM (Linear)

I presently work in finance, advising projects when developing new applications (or changes to existing) on best practice, standards, how or what they should be doing etc. Previously I’ve worked in GRC, been a IT Manager and IT Support grunt across finance, retail and OT.

I wouldn’t say my current role is full blown Security Architect. The role is very hands off with technology, and mostly advising and drafting standards, patterns a guidelines (e.g. API design) but having to quickly digest technology and solution designs. It’s pretty dull tbh.

While the job is hands off, I do spend some time learning and trying things that are hands on, for example at the moment that includes cloud services from a particular vendor, learning to use GitHub actions, terraform, testing etc. Got a wee side project trying to create a Serverless CA solution using something open source, possibly going to use Step-CA (might be too much for one person but let’s see).

Part of me wants to take a step back into a job that is much more hands on again, but then the stuff I currently do (in work and personal time) makes me think I’m closer to a Solution Architect than something specifically Security. My current mode feels very adrift and aimless since the job market is rubbish. I’m just trying to feather my bows in readiness for something that comes along when hopefully the market improves.

Reading this hopefully isn’t too vague. But if anyone reading this had any thoughts or suggestions, insights or experiences?

I have been in this position with my current company for a few years now, but I feel like I am struggling to keep up with others on my team. We have another Architect (classic high-performer) who is light years ahead of me, particularly in the cloud space (where we all increasingly operate, of course). While this person is the only direct comparison I have in my org, it used to be easier to let this gap slide because this other person has a general reputation as a beast, however we have since hired on some Engineers who are also ahead of me in the cloud space, and it is getting more difficult to justify my continued position to myself.

I understand that what is most important is that my boss is satisfied with my work (she has given no indications she feels otherwise), and I am not exactly slacking, but now I am in a position where I lack both the knowledge and output level of my fellow Architect, and I also have more qualified Engineers coming up behind me. I landed this position at an earlier time in our team maturity but I do not feel that I have really advanced since then, which makes me feel more and more like a legacy. I know the easy answer here: I should just take the time to study more and skill up. The problem is I mostly lost interest in the IT field years ago, and not just in an ambivalent way -- I mean I have grown to actively dislike this industry more and more. Big tech is working hard to undermine our societal cohesion in the name of profits, the cloud is creating serfs of us all, and the field of cybersecurity itself is becoming more and more of a slap-new-tech-over-the-top-to-cover-up-the-real-problems circle-jerk. I refuse to attend conferences (why should I care about 15 cookie-cutter vendors hawking the newest AI-powered CSPM tool -- now complete with XDR integration!) And whenever I DO bother to tune into Blackhat or SecureWorld or whatever (remotely of course, because I have no interest in paying for the privilege of getting COVID at an in-person), every keynote address seems to include some variation of ""rates of compromise are increasing and we are doing worse at cybersecurity"". I sit for training every year and enjoy learning new things, but I actively avoid any certs because I have no interest in maintaining any more than I already do, and (again) I find myself increasingly hostile to a lot of tech. At this point I am really only still doing what I do because it pays well, but it is a real slog for me (I understand work is a four-letter word for many folks, but this is not really an industry that suffers pessimists either).

Ultimately I am wondering what others in similar senior individual contributor positions have done when they encounter these challenges of feeling increasingly alienated from the tech. Have you switched over to a management role? Moved into Consulting or research? Jumped ship and left the industry altogether? I make good money, work/life balance is great, and (as noted) my management seems satisfied with my output, but I feel like I am letting my coworkers down (people come to me for technical guidance less than they used to), and I no longer have much interest in what I do (indeed, I am developing a bit of a reputation as a contrarian on the team). I am in my 40s and do not have plans to voluntarily leave this role any time soon, but I feel am also too young to not start forming a backup plan for a new career because I am a ways off from even early retirement...

Thanks!",feel like i am being outpaced by coworkers hi all current security architect here. i have been in this position with my current company for a few years now but i feel like i am struggling to keep up with others on my team. we have another architect who is light years ahead of me particularly in the cloud space . while this person is the only direct comparison i have in my org it used to be easier to let this gap slide because this other person has a general reputation as a beast however we have since hired on some engineers who are also ahead of me in the cloud space and it is getting more difficult to justify my continued position to myself. i understand that what is most important is that my boss is satisfied with my work and i am not exactly slacking but now i am in a position where i lack both the knowledge and output level of my fellow architect and i also have more qualified engineers coming up behind me. i landed this position at an earlier time in our team maturity but i do not feel that i have really advanced since then which makes me feel more and more like a legacy. i know the easy answer here: i should just take the time to study more and skill up. the problem is i mostly lost interest in the it field years ago and not just in an ambivalent way    i mean i have grown to actively dislike this industry more and more. big tech is working hard to undermine our societal cohesion in the name of profits the cloud is creating serfs of us all and the field of cybersecurity itself is becoming more and more of a slap new tech over the top to cover up the real problems circle jerk. i refuse to attend conferences and whenever i do bother to tune into blackhat or secureworld or whatever every keynote address seems to include some variation of rates of compromise are increasing and we are doing worse at cybersecurity . i sit for training every year and enjoy learning new things but i actively avoid any certs because i have no interest in maintaining any more than i already do and i find myself increasingly hostile to a lot of tech. at this point i am really only still doing what i do because it pays well but it is a real slog for me . ultimately i am wondering what others in similar senior individual contributor positions have done when they encounter these challenges of feeling increasingly alienated from the tech. have you switched over to a management role moved into consulting or research jumped ship and left the industry altogether i make good money work life balance is great and my management seems satisfied with my output but i feel like i am letting my coworkers down and i no longer have much interest in what i do . i am in my   s and do not have plans to voluntarily leave this role any time soon but i feel am also too young to not start forming a backup plan for a new career because i am a ways off from even early retirement... thanks,1,5,3566,2892,2024,4,Friday,20,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1bwssw9/feel_like_i_am_being_outpaced_by_coworkers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1bwssw9/feel_like_i_am_being_outpaced_by_coworkers/,1,0.6531256534633995,0.6531256534633995,SVM (Linear)

I work for a mid-sized MSP as a Security Analyst, which if you've done similar you know means I do anything remotely 'security' coded, including IR and forensics, helpdesk tickets, audits, projects, internal educational campaigns, etc etc.This is my first cybersec job, and I've been in the role for two years. The company was my first IT job and I pivoted to cyber after two years.

The good: I have freedom to build my role how I want, I get lots of experience in different things, and I basically have an unlimited PD budget.

The bad: It's an MSP. I could be making far more money working literally anywhere else. I'm constantly busy and getting burnt out. I'm the sole sec analyst for 150+ clients.

My boss has mentioned that I should get CISSP a few times now, including the last time we talked about my PD goals. I did try to explain to her that it's a leadership cert, expensive, and you need 5 years experience, but that didn't seem to deter her. I literally just got my Security+ and I'm working on my SSCP and SC-400. 

I don't really know how to feel about this situation, but my initial feeling was that it's silly. I have literally no interest in going into leadership, plus I'd probably be the lowest paid CISSP in history. I don't know if she realizes that getting my CISSP would give me every reason to leave the MSP and work somewhere else. Plus all the studying would have to be on personal time (which I know is the norm) but I volunteer, do sport, have hobbies, and my partner is in a doctoral program so bulk of housework falls to me.

Still, they'd pay for it and the training, which is massive. I know a lot of folks would kill to be in my position, and a lot of jobs and companies like mine wouldn't pay for the CISSP and training.

So, looking for opinions on what I should do. Since this is my first cyber job I don't know if this situation is typical, a red flag, or if I'm looking a gift horse in the mouth and will regret my decision to not go for CISSP.

TIA.

I am an information security engineer, and I was layed off on the week of March 11th, '24. Since then, I have applied for \~200 infosec jobs. I have been presented with 7 companies that wish to move forward with the interview process in the first 3 weeks of applying. I didn't find it super challenging to land an interview. I consider 7 interviews in 3 weeks decently fast.

So I ask, am I misunderstanding the infosec job market? Is landing a job in infosec a challenge just for entry level roles?  What makes the job market challenging for some candidates, and not so challenging for others? Am I out of touch with the challenges candidates are facing in the infosec job market?

Here's what I'm looking for - In my experience one of the most difficult things with performing a gap analysis against csf is helping the organization's leadership decide on their goal/target score. Everyone *wants* to be at tier 4, but that is not always a realistic goal across the board for a lot of orgs. This process can definitely be easy if they have a CISO or CIO involved who is knowledgeable on cybersecurity and understands the business side of the house pretty well. But that's not common.

A CEO may say they want to be at a 4, but when you ask them if they're willing to commit x number of man hours per year to achieve the level of documentation required, or spend x number of dollars to buy some software that is needed to accomplish that goal, they suddenly decide that they are actually ok with a 2 or 3 in that area.

The types of questions I have in mind are not technical, or even questions about how the business or cybersec are currently operating or performing. They would be questions centered around risk appetite, and how much time, energy, resources they are comfortable investing in a particular area to address a certain risk.

I know these are questions that are often asked ad hoc in assessments and during the creation of various things like BIA's, and individuals probably have their own personal list of questions they keep in a word document they've got tucked away, but I'm looking for a straightforward list of questions specifically mapped to CSF that is publicly available that someone could walk through with an executive to at least get a general idea of what their goal scores are going to land on. I wish NIST offered something like this.","NIST CSF Executive Goals Questionnaire

So I am working for an auto parts manufacturing company who DOES NOT have their ISO 27001 certification. I was originally hired about 6 months ago as both IT Support and a ""Documentation Specialist"" due to my actual past experience for building documentation. The problem is I have never worked on ISO Certification and I was very specific on informing them of that in the interview. I didn't want to leave a steady job I was already at to come to a place where I could potentially fail the intended goal due to inexperience.

Just to provide context, let me explain how I got to this point. I had interviewed with this company some time ago and although I didn't get that position, they did seem to like me a lot. After that I found a position with a different company. A year later, they called me back in for an interview, informing me they had created a new position and wanted me to fill it specifically because of my presented experience. That position was their ""Documentation Specialist"" and I was to ""help them get ISO certified. I initially declined them in since I was comfortable where I was at, but they provided me an impressive offer letter and I decided to take a shot. I let them know right away that I was ill-experienced with ISO Certification and wouldn't even know where to start. They assured me they had an ISO Consultant and he could guide me through the process. All they cared about was that I could build documentation, or so that's how they spoke.   
  
Okay, wonderful. So I took a shot, rolled the dice. It should be noted that between the day of my interview and the first day I started (about three weeks), the ""IT Manager"" who had spearheaded my hiring had been let go. There was now an immediate management vacuum and as I learned more I found out that the CFO was technically our CTO. Another manager in charge of our ERP systems was placed as temporary IT Manager.   
  
So to start I had very little in the way of direct guidance. I was mainly providing local IT support for the office I was stationed at as well as kind of fumbling around documentation without much direction for the first 3-4 months. This unfortunately drew in the direct attention of the CFO who directed the aforementioned temporary IT manager to collect weekly reports and do daily morning check-ins. 

So here I am now, I was finally provided some additional guidance by the third-party ISO consultant, provided one of the ISO template packs, to which I began to brand the documents to our own and attempted to follow the implementation checklist that was provided in order to make progress. I am learning quite a bit about ISO 27001 and the process of building an ISMS. However, I'm still very much green in this department. The ISO template pack provided was the one from Hightable, and I have to say I hate everything about their spreadsheets. Why so much whitespace? UGH. Side gripe. I now feel like after the initial document checklist and branding them all to our own, I've hit another wall. And being that I'm expected to now provide weekly work logs, I feel a bit of pressure again.

So my question at this point is really a request for advice. I do feel that after branding the new policy documents, I am attempting to go through their ISMS implementation checklist, but on my most recent meeting with our temporary manager it was told to me that I would need to be the one filling these out. Which is to say documents that define the Review Team and who the document owners are. I tried to stress that some of this policy would not be written by me and would need to be properly set and filled out document by document. This also seemed to induce a bit of pushback. So I don't know at this point. What should I be doing here? Is there an easier process or better way I could be putting in work into this project?

P.S And if you're going to recommend I get my resume ready and back out there, trust me I did and have been.","Newly Hired to a Company for ISO 27001 Despite Lack of Experience - Help

Hey everyone,

I’m reaching out here in desperation because I’m at my wit's end. I’ve put in years of hard work, earned multiple certifications, and completed my schooling, all with the dream of breaking into the cybersecurity field. But here I am, and I can't even land a basic IT job, let alone something in my chosen field.

I've got a laundry list of certifications and a AAS and BS in cyber, I thought these would open doors for me, but it seems like every application I send out disappears into a black hole.

I have 1.5 years of experience as a SOC analyst prior to working this job, and before that about 6 months in helpdesk.  When I first interviewed with this new company, I was told that most of my time would be writing and tuning detections in various security products, and occasionally helping analysts with understanding the detection.  I was also told that they would be hiring a lot of new cybersecurity employees because the team count was very low at that point because of some layoffs the company did a couple years ago and a lot of the team moving onto new companies.  I accepted the offer despite my slight worry about this red flag (detection engineering is the subfield I really want to work in)  
Anyways, a couple months pass and I'm was even less sure about this role.  The security culture within the organization was so terrible it honestly made me kind of depressed, the leadership seemed be incapable of improving it in any way and was passive aggressive with the entire team, and the worst part, the team grew even smaller as a couple people left within this time and we were informed that there would be a hiring freeze for the security team as the organization did not want to provide an adequate budget for us.  
I started to slowly take on more and more responsibilities, both from the team members who had recently left and for the roles that we did not have a budget to hire.  This really disappointed me because I really wanted to focus on improving my detection engineering skills, and I was only doing that maybe 25% of the time and the other time I was just doing stuff tangentially related.  I had the title of ""Detection engineer"" but my responsibilities by the third month didn't really reflect this title.  
Eventually, in a moment of emotional weakness I decided that I had enough, and I would find a role where I had both the title and responsibilities of a detection engineer.  I was in a financially good spot with about a year of expenses and decided to quit, without notice (which I slightly regret)  
I feel like for the first 2 months, I learned a lot about detection engineering.  I did a significant amount of work building out detections in the various security products starting from essentially product defaults.  I feel that I would be very proud to display this on my resume or talk about it during the interview.  
My question is, should I keep this 4 months of experience on my resume when applying for other detection engineer jobs? I feel that having the title and the first 2 months of experience reflecting the title might be helpful for my job search.  On the other hand, I had only worked there for 4 months and I quit without notice.

Joined as an L1 SOC analyst almost a year back and the work is very unsatisfying personally. The only thing I do is check alerts from XDR/EDR tools, Mark a verdict and send a 5-10 sentence report as the 'analysis'. There is no other work for me, i do not configure anything, don't work on SIEM, nothing. I'm good at what i do and that's because the job is too easy at this point. 

I have no prior work experience so this is my first job and even then i don't feel like i am being challenged at all. I did my MSC in information Security, and truth be told i feel my course focused on GRC more other practical knowledge (had a bit of that too though). 

However,  not sure I'll enjoy the work or the pay working in GRC and though i know a bit, the intermediate levels of coding (Python), i am not sure if i can excel at DevSecOps or pentesting as these domains needs a much deeper understanding than what i have right now. I could learn but it'd take ages to be ""good"" at it. 

I also hate being a soc since the shifts keeps changing and my body just doesn't like the fact that it has to adapt every few weeks. Finding a SOC role which pays well, and doesn't have night shift is really difficult given those jobs are a rarity here in India.


Feels like I've hit a brick wall. I'm working on gaining knowledge, certifications and stuff but working my way up from scratch without a clear idea of what to do is a bit difficult. Also, finding a good job without work experience is a pain I'm sure everyone knows.

I need major help in determining how to go forth from here in terms of career. I historically was of the software engineering hobby-type and tinkerer and then started working in a SOC after graduating with a bachelors degree in computer science. It was during covid and that was the job I could get -- and was thankful to have. 

I'm completely burned out on Alerts, ATOs, and vulnerabilities and am looking for a new job after about 4 years experience total. This market is of course... a bit rough -- and I hate doing SOC work. I'd rather be typing code and working with cloud appsec/prodsec etc and being technical specialist hands on. I also am not historically of the IT type where I started as a Sysadmin, Network firewall admin, etc. 

Had an interview today for an architect position. The hiring manager said the following which was kind of interesting to hear -- and in my opinion a bit of a red flag:

**Potential Minuses**

* I’d be expected to be team lead and do some managerial duties down the line. The exact balance between being individual contributor and team lead would vary per my interviewer's wording, depending on how he views the new staff member's strengths. If he thinks someone is stronger individual contributor, they'll manage less
* People would come to me with questions and seeking advice, especially the contractors **\[this position is to be the only FTE on the team -- and to become the manager's right-hand man\]**
* Less playing hands on with technical toys and skills, more about consulting on projects to identify risks in architecture and addressing it accordingly
* SANS training opportunity attendance is relatively fewer. He mentioned how hard it was to get it for employees due to price ($8,000 per training... apparently they don't get a discount on class purchases). That's interesting to hear, but I could do some cloud certs out of my own pocket
* 4x360 reviews, four people review you for promo and annual review. So one needs to be very strong and collaborative both with people within and outside the security architecture team, where four people give you a performance feedback for yearly review
* Harder to retain technical skills and capabilities in this role. Architecture is just a bit abstract. So in this role technical skills can completely atrophy.... I historically have been more technically hands on

**Pluses of this role:**

* Larger company in financial services. potential to move around internally if I need something better \[i guess, didn't confirm this with hiring manager\]
* It's potentially the job I can get in this market. Have been hunting since August 2023 for a new gig
* Leaving a poorly run SOC and lack of technical, career, and fiscal growth. I do not want to see another alert in my life
* Potentially some appsec component to it, the manager wants a combination of appsec and netsec. That plays right into my programming background  


\-----------------------------------------------

How do you all react to this? Is the architecture role worth considering? Or not? My biggest concern is it being more abstract and not technically involved hands-on. 

Thank you in advance for the insights!","Advice needed regarding potential job

tl;dr: Our C-level lives in the past, doesnt care for information security. Trying to do the job of the CISO while getting paid as an IT-assistant and getting blocked by the CIO in most ways. WTH is wrong? 

(Sorry for butchering the English language, I’m not a native English speaker) I’m currently trying to get the company I work for into information security (my role is more on the organizational side but I try to get into the technical side of it). You COULD call me kind of a CISO, except I’m not, my formal role is IT Assistant. Sounds plausible as I only have 2 yrs of experience. 

As of my understanding, if you do the isms part correctly (and bcms aswell), you get to know your risks in the Information security and can implement the right controls to mitigate them and thus having the real benefit of reduced risk of getting attacked an in case of an attack (bcms side of things) you should get the business back up quicker, because you did prepare yourself, know what to do and (mostly) have, what you need to get everything running again asap. 

I’m aware that there’s a big organizational part in it which is more “just compliance”, but it’s not just work for nothing except compliance. 

Yesterday I had a meeting with some consultants and our CIO (who got me hired in the first place because of NIS2). He told the consultants, that there’s no benefit in really going for the isms side of things and that we’ll do it as sloppy as possible to meet regulation needs but nothing more to get the money going “where it has a real benefit”. For context: Our C-level has no clue of IT in general and they couldn’t care less. The general attitude in the C-level is stuck in the 1990s, so are parts of the company. 

The way I got the message is kinda I have a bullshit job no one cares about in the company and they don’t want to do anything in this direction. 

I did not find the time to ask our CIO, what he really meant by saying this, but when I talk to him he seems like he wants to let me do my part, just not in the CISO position. That’s why I only report to him, he takes my work and chooses if and what to talk about with the C-Level, which is the least part of what I’m doing. 

I also wanted to get a further course to improve my skills. When I applied for the job they told me, that I could do that course in the first 6 months. Now we’re nearly a year in and the course is nowhere to be found. 

Frustration got to a level where I’m close to do the course out of my own pocket (around 4kEuro) and look for another job. 

Now for my question: is the CISO really seen as a bullshit-job (mostly EU, US is a bit more on the “lets try something new”-side of things), or is that a role that can have a real impact, if the c-level isnt that stubborn?
Maybe it’s less about the question and more about the rant, sorry. ","Uselessnes of NIS2 (EU)

Maybe it’s less about the question and more about the rant, sorry.",uselessnes of nis  hello tl dr: our c level lives in the past doesnt care for information security. trying to do the job of the ciso while getting paid as an it assistant and getting blocked by the cio in most ways. wth is wrong i m currently trying to get the company i work for into information security . you could call me kind of a ciso except i m not my formal role is it assistant. sounds plausible as i only have   yrs of experience. as of my understanding if you do the isms part correctly you get to know your risks in the information security and can implement the right controls to mitigate them and thus having the real benefit of reduced risk of getting attacked an in case of an attack you should get the business back up quicker because you did prepare yourself know what to do and have what you need to get everything running again asap. i m aware that there s a big organizational part in it which is more just compliance but it s not just work for nothing except compliance. yesterday i had a meeting with some consultants and our cio . he told the consultants that there s no benefit in really going for the isms side of things and that we ll do it as sloppy as possible to meet regulation needs but nothing more to get the money going where it has a real benefit . for context: our c level has no clue of it in general and they couldn t care less. the general attitude in the c level is stuck in the     s so are parts of the company. the way i got the message is kinda i have a bullshit job no one cares about in the company and they don t want to do anything in this direction. i did not find the time to ask our cio what he really meant by saying this but when i talk to him he seems like he wants to let me do my part just not in the ciso position. that s why i only report to him he takes my work and chooses if and what to talk about with the c level which is the least part of what i m doing. i also wanted to get a further course to improve my skills. when i applied for the job they told me that i could do that course in the first   months. now we re nearly a year in and the course is nowhere to be found. frustration got to a level where i m close to do the course out of my own pocket and look for another job. now for my question: is the ciso really seen as a bullshit job or is that a role that can have a real impact if the c level isnt that stubborn maybe it s less about the question and more about the rant sorry.,0,6,2867,2452,2024,4,Friday,9,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1c7s710/uselessnes_of_nis2_eu/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1c7s710/uselessnes_of_nis2_eu/,1,0.37417572445656117,0.6258242755434389,SVM (Linear)

But idont know how to describe it, its like im getting overwhelmed, even when i take days off. okay i get my 2 days off to cool down but whenever i return its just hectic. there are few issues here and there but i feel like im getting drained, i cant simply quit and search for another job its so Hectic here and the pay is low.

I am not a very active reddit user, and if similar question was asked before I bring my apologies.  


Matter is that, I recently got a job offer as a data security engineer where my primary goals will be:  
1. Creating data classification policy  
2. Developing a DLP implementation strategy   
3. Infosec documentation revision  
4. Other more technical tasks  


My experience background is 1.5 years as a penetration tester and 4 months in security governance team.  
Even tho I will probably have no issues wit technical tasks, I feel like I am not completely ready for what my manager will mainly ask me for. During the recruitment process he said that my lack of experience is okay but still, I want to bring as much as possible on the table from day 1.  
I am super excited to take this challenge but obviously I am also scared.  


My question is, do you have any learning material recommendations for me before I start the new position?  
Any courses, books, certifications? Some concepts that you would recommend me to get familiar with? Any tips on how to approach my tasks and what can be a good start? Any comment, tip and recommendation is highly appreciated.   


Thanks in advance <3","Got a data security engineer job, scared af, what to do
Hello, dear forum mates,  


I am not a very active reddit user, and if similar question was asked before I bring my apologies.  


Matter is that, I recently got a job offer as a data security engineer where my primary goals will be:  
1. Creating data classification policy  
2. Developing a DLP implementation strategy   
3. Infosec documentation revision  
4. Other more technical tasks  


My experience background is 1.5 years as a penetration tester and 4 months in security governance team.  
Even tho I will probably have no issues wit technical tasks, I feel like I am not completely ready for what my manager will mainly ask me for. During the recruitment process he said that my lack of experience is okay but still, I want to bring as much as possible on the table from day 1.

I’m currently in my third term at a small private university that has a dedicated cybersecurity track, and based off of what research I’ve done regarding important subject areas that are necessary to be successful in cyber (i.e. networking fundamentals, troubleshooting, routing and switching, firewalls, vpns, Linux etc.) the curriculum seems legit. Internships are offered at certain points as available courses, and a handful of the courses are set up basically as certification preps (CompTIA A+, Security +, AWS, etc.).

I have an opportunity to go to a higher rated school and was wondering if it’s worth it to put effort into trying to get in or stick it out where I’m currently attending. The college only offers a general CS undergrad degree. They have a Master’s program for cyber, but from what I understand Master’s really isn’t helpful or advisable until I’ve already established myself in a career. 

To be completely honest, I would like to be able to say that I graduated from such and such school (maybe a little conceited, I know), but if the people who hire don’t care all that much and the school that I’m currently attending gives me more applicable knowledge, then I don’t see the point in spending the time and effort.

Any advice helps, thanks.
I’m a little older, not typical college age.
Money for tuition is not a factor.","Worth it to transfer to a more prestigious school for a general CS degree?

I've been in cybersecurity for over 4 years, mainly doing appsec, some VAPT and GRC stuff. Despite being a software engineering graduate, I've never been interested in coding much and always leaned towards building a career in cybersecurity mainly defensive security/blue team.

Got a job at a decent company through college and was aligned to appsec/VAPT  as they needed a resource there and not in SOC. Over time, I moved up from security analyst to security engineer II. However, I always felt that appsec wasn't where my passion lies. But people working at my org in SOC IR alway used to complain about stress and no WLB which made me hesitant to join SOC.

  
Now, the reality sinked in when I explored new job opportunities, I realised that many appsec/VAPT roles require development experience or knowledge of multiple programming languages, which I feel I lack. While I could pivot to pentesting/red teaming, the job market is limited for that and requires scripting/automation skills which I can manage but still not my first choice.

  
So am considering moving to IR and threat hunting, or cloud security within my current organization. Since I still love working in core security field. Unsure if it's a right move at this time in my career or if I should focus on refining coding skills and stay in appsec.  
Would it look bad on my resume that I moved to SOC or cloud security after 4 years? Would my past experience be relevant for finding new blue team jobs?

  
TL;DR: I've been in cybersecurity for over 4 years, focusing on appsec but that's not what am passionate about. Despite 2 promotions, I feel I lack coding skills needed for landing new appsec roles and truly excel at it. Considering switching to my passion for blue team roles like SOC or threat hunting, but unsure if it's the right move at this stage. Should I focus on coding for appsec or pursue my passion for blue team roles(IR/threat hunting/cloud sec)? Would it be a wise move?","After 4 years, considering a transition from AppSec to SOC (IR/Threat Hunting) or Cloud Security.

Just got punted out of my 4th job in 5 years. Don’t want to say the specialization - I feel like it’s a tight crowd - but I’m sure I’ll tell on myself partway through here anyway. 

Please bear with me. I don’t just want to complain, the practices I’ve seen have made me truly worried about the geopolitical and ethical implications of what this means for the future.

I never made it to any big time firms… which probably worked out for me anyway, but I keep getting dropped for failure to integrate with the culture. Or not being a team player. Didn’t keep my camera off/abuse anybody, but it was more like…

“Hey, we’re totally committing commercial software license fraud.”
“Hey, we’re totally cooking our books and manufacturing invoiced work that never happened.”
“Hey, we’re totally fabricating our SME presence.”
“Hey, we’re totally lying to this client… and they’re making ME do it.”
“Hey, managers are totally taking credit for other people’s work to conduct bonus fraud.”


Queue dirty looks, abusive reprimands, and a constant reminders that “u/RemarkableNobody is a perfectionist, and if you want to make it in this field you really shouldn’t conduct yourself like they do.” I’m not even going to talk much about the stonewalling I always got when trying to move to positions with better fit, or trying to work with my managers when things aren’t working out. What’s the point? We all already know about it. I just wanted to do my job to a standard. 

Fellas… fellettes… I’m just so fucking exhausted. I went to an expensive school to be a SME in the security space. I *loved* helping businesses - and the people in those businesses - get with the program and keep their networks safe. I have a disgusting amount of experience doing my boss’s job because they just *wouldn’t do it* and make me panic-deliver shit work, make me deliver the cover story, then say: “hoowee, we made it happen, that’s what makes us rockstars. Anyway, lie on the report please.” If anything were to spark up… the only one touching the mess is me.

I couldn’t enforce the very basics of safe architecture, a direct responsibility of my role. Had to watch OWASP vectors flap in the wind for huge networks. Had to greenlight shit setups because it would be too expensive to get “that hung up on one client, they’ll be fine.”

Anything goes wrong, fuck it, E&O coverage and the legal team exists right?

All my MSP partner teams would just be criminals. Shit goes wrong, they flush the evidence and say “oops teehee.” Nobody gets in trouble. And all around me, Fortune 50s are ignoring kindergarten warning signs while every major sensitive database makes it to the dark market, public and private. Meanwhile, all the big firms and tech giants are devaluing these skills and expecting more and more from anyone they do hire. I’m a personal privacy activist and my heart breaks every day.   

I’ve been totally insomniac for 2 years. I watch the sun come up and cry. I log out of my workstation and puke into a toilet. I break shit, I scream, I hide from everyone. I did everything I could to be a quiet professional, but it feels like I’ve just been gaslit into ignoring the absolute state of enterprise security compliance. And now I think I’ve lost it. 


I’m wrong, aren’t I? Most of you had a better experience than I did, surely - I really think all I need to hear is some simple reassurance that we are not all working for criminals and charlatans who get to do anything they want because the state of security compliance enforcement is a joke… and not everyone is gutting entire business units because executives need to rabidly lie about being two seconds from complete insolvency. It can’t just be all private equity-sourced hostile takeovers… good talent and good teams getting thrown aside (not me, colleagues with much more to lose) for nickels on leadership bonuses…


This is a mess, I know. But I really need to get set straight. Everyone I was supposed to respect professionally tells me I’m wrong, so I must be. If that’s true, I’ll just wipe the dirt off my pants and keep at this.

I just can’t right now.

I work for a pretty large MSSP in SOC in the U.S. I'm closing in on almost 3 years here, a couple months ago I was promoted to senior security analyst. I noticed a trend starting early last year, the company starting doing layoffs at first for the tier 1 soc roles and helpdesk, not all of them but a good amount, then after a week or so we were introduced to new team members for the same roles that were laid off but they were based in India. Then in Sept of last year, layoffs again, this time tier 2 where I was at, at the time. Same thing a week later more teammates from India. Finally once I was promoted a couple months ago to a senior I thought I would be safe. 2 weeks ago, again layoffs announced, this time some of our security engineers and software engineers, you can see the cycle here, surprise, the following week those roles were replaced by people in India.  

Now almost 40% of my team is based out of India in the SOC, I know with our helpdesk the figure is higher, and with engineering its probably somewhere in the 20%. To be honest without disrespecting anyone, ever since the arrival of the employees from India, our quality of work has declined drastically, I am continually having to intervene on tickets worked by them, which is taking more time from myself having to work on high priority situations, we are constantly having miscommunication issues and it has made work much more difficult then it needs to be. Customers are filing more complaints then ever, some of our application projects for engineering that were due to be released months ago have been pushed for a further timeframe of 5 to 6 months. We had some of our biggest clients telling us that they will have to think carefully if they will want to renew their contract with us.

One of the main reasons I went into cybersecurity and spent so much time on education and certifications was because I was being told and led to believe this is a secure field for job risk. I understand a corporation's main goal is to generate profit. But I thought roles in this industry would be more inclined to not be outsourced due to the nature of security data that US companies would be inclined to not have that data accessible overseas.

So I can see the writing on the wall, either the company will start laying off the seniors and replacing us for cheaper labor or they will want us to stay here to oversee the environment. Doesn't matter to me though because I don't want to work at this company anymore due to the reasons I stated above. I am continually seeing headlines of these tech layoffs but one of the main backings of these that isn't talked about enough in my opinion is outsourcing. 

  
So as I brush up my resume to start looking for another job, which sucks to think about because I genuinely enjoyed working at this company previously. I think to myself and hopefully I can gain some insight from all of you, what roles in the security field are less prone to outsourcing? I am mostly experienced in blue team/defense security and incident response, should I start looking at red team? cloud security? application security? or a specific industry in security?

I am currently working in cybersec, but on a branch that is completely defensive. More precisely reading aggregated and simplified sysmon telemetry from an AV solution and remotely act upon active threats. I do not work with SIEM, advanced networking or Linux,  and GPT4 is my best friend when I need to identify a potential compromised endpoint based on the internal running processes and commands that might corelate with SIGMA rules. But besides this, I have no skills in coding, networking, linux or any kind of offensive skills or something that would truly qualify me as a cybersec expert. 

My question is, considering the fast dev of AI and possibly quantum computers in the next 5-10 years, is it still worth to force myself into learning all of the above mentioned? (Please note that those are very hard for me to grasp due to age and adhd). Will the future tech framework make the current informational tech obsolete?

However, the reality is that my responsibilities lean heavily towards auditing, policy drafting, and procedure development.

Despite my dissatisfaction with the role itself, the company , culture and overall environment are fantastic. There's ample opportunity for growth, which is what initially drew me in, even though the position wasn't precisely what I had in mind.

I’ve been with a company (third party payment processing company) for around 15 years now. We have a small IT team of about 5 people. Our CISO recently left the company and I’ve been promoted to an ISM (Information Security Manager) position. While I appreciate the promotion, I know a lot of the CISOs current workload will fall on me now. 

I’ve been in the IT field for the entire length of my career at this company and have worn many, many hats due to our small team. A chunk of it security related as we are also PCI certified so I'm not a novice in the space.

I just want to make sure I have my ducks in a row and further better our security posture/position. Any tips from others in the field for someone newly taking over a security manager position would be most welcome. Here are my current thoughts.

* Get my CISSP (It’s something I was looking at going after last year, just didn't get around to it)

Quick summary

I’ve been with a company (third party payment processing company) for around 15 years now. We have a small IT team of about 5 people. Our CISO recently left the company and I’ve been promoted to an ISM (Information Security Manager) position. While I appreciate the promotion, I know a lot of the CISOs current workload will fall on me now. 

I’ve been in the IT field for the entire length of my career at this company and have worn many, many hats due to our small team. A chunk of it security related as we are also PCI certified so I'm not a novice in the space.

I just want to make sure I have my ducks in a row and further better our security posture/position. Any tips from others in the field for someone newly taking over a security manager position would be most welcome. Here are my current thoughts.

* Get my CISSP (It’s something I was looking at going after last year, just didn't get around to it)

Started out as a engineering consultant, moved to network and system administration, moved into Infrastructure Management - Company sizes I've worked are 500 million private, 1 Public 500 million and one private billion dollar organization as well as stents for a public security company.

I currently work for an organization that has two MSP's and have been promoted to Director of Security for both.  The two MSP's don't have synergy's from a software stack perspective or even the same client profile.  I have a very small team of 4 which one is an intern so will go to 3.  I have the capability to oursource some of the work as well.  There are probably 90 - 100 clients between companies and of course potential new clients all the time.

My background is more technical but one of the MSP's is somewhat heavy into compliance.  I believe I can pick up the compliance part but on top of my new position I'm also performing a pre-sales role related to Cloud and Security.

There is more but long story short, I'm looking for thoughts on how to get my head around all of this in a quick fashion. Just thoughts from those with years of experience.  I'm pretty capable.  I understand security, have my CISM and will take the CISSP exam at this point just so I can say I have it but I have a pretty daunting task and thought it would be helpful to get input from others that are in the trenches.","Promoted to Director of Cyber (MSP) - Looking for advice

I've been doing research into a bunch of different masters programs and I can't find a masters program that I would want to do other than Georgia Tech's. I was originally going to apply for the spring 2025 session but now I'm thinking about waiting building a better profile then applying for Fall 2025. I'm specifically interested in their malware analysis courses and how deep the program goes in reverse engineering. 

I'm still very young and have a ton of time lets just say I'm not even 21 yet.

**My Current Profile**

* Bachelors degree in cybersecurity from WGU, was originally at a university for two years where I held a 4.0 GPA.
* I currently have been working as a Cyber Threat Analyst for about a 1.5 years and held 3 other cyber internships before that.

**Current Certifications**

* Comptia Network+, A+, Security+
* SSCP
* ITIL4 Foundations
* Blue Team Level 1
* CYSA+
* Pentest+
* Practical Junior Malware Researcher

I see that the degree requires quiet a bit of programming knowledge, while I have that knowledge I haven't take a ton of programming classes I believe thats where my application will be weak at.

If you had about 7 months to prep for your application what would you do?

Thanks in advance!","Advice on acceptance into Georgia Tech cyber masters program

Usually, the answer is that if you need to ask the question on Reddit, you are not ready. That is true. I am not ready to start a cybersecurity firm. I am a decent programmer with three years of real-world experience in IT. My strongest skill is web applications/web scraping. I do not like working with programming and web scraping as a service to others. I mostly create things that help my colleagues or me become more effective. I have good knowledge of databases, scripting, and networking. I know how to use tools and read documentation. Where I suffer is in some security concepts and architectures, assembly code, and pentesting.

I have a big love for cybersecurity, and I always come back to it. I will try to learn more and do some CTFs. After one or two more months, my plan is to start a cybersecurity business but offer my services for free to smaller businesses. Sometimes we learn by jumping into things, which is how I learned programming. I never had the patience to watch a full course. I do projects and then learn by doing. If I do not understand something, I read different documentation and watch specific YouTube videos about the concept.

This is the services I want to offer to companies that are smaller to medium: 

1. **Credential Monitoring**
   * **Service Description:** Check if employee credentials are leaked on the darknet or through public data breaches.
   * **Tools:** Have I Been Pwned API, DeHashed, SpyCloud, Darknet.
   * **Added Value:** Provide actionable reports and recommendations for password updates and multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementation.
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   * **Service Description:** Identify and report vulnerabilities in websites, applications, and network infrastructure.
   * **Tools:** OpenVAS, Nikto, OWASP ZAP, Nessus (free for personal use).
   * **Added Value:** Include a remediation plan and follow-up scans to ensure vulnerabilities are addressed.
3. **Phishing Simulations and Education**
   * **Service Description:** Conduct phishing tests to assess employee susceptibility and provide training to recognize and handle phishing attempts.
   * **Tools:** Gophish, PhishMe Free, PhishingBox.
   * **Added Value:** Offer customized training sessions and materials based on the results of the simulations.
4. **Network Security Audits**
   * **Service Description:** Assess the overall security of the network infrastructure, identify weaknesses, and recommend improvements.
   * **Tools:** Wireshark, Nmap, Netwrix Auditor (free version).
   * **Added Value:** Provide a comprehensive report with prioritized action items and periodic follow-up assessments.

Primarily I’m managing firewalls, some SIEM involvement indirectly through our SOC, some incident response, playbook and SIEM rule design. A little bit of firewall rule auditing and governance stuff. But other than the firewalls it’s all very shallow knowledge as I’m not involved deep enough.

I feel like my network skills are falling away now due to lack of use, and I don’t know whether to keep them fresh. Certs like CCNP are due to expire soon. 

I have my firewall skills and certs which are my primary skill. But I feel like this will only carry me so far, who’s to say firewalls as we know them will still be prominent in a few more years. 

I dabbled with some red team stuff, recently tried some HTB challenges which highlighted my absolute lack of knowledge in this area.
So I’m gravitating towards more blue team skills as this is more my strength at the moment. But should I gain some more red team skills?

Then operations in general, sysadmin type work, I still gravitate towards this area too, mainly due to familiarity of being in operations for so long. And I’m reluctant to abandon the network skills but I wonder it’s holding me back trying to maintain this.

Basically I feel like my exposure and skills to all these areas is too shallow, and that I need to focus more.

I’m approaching late 30s, not a spring chicken anymore. In an ideal world I’d love to retire or at least reduce my hours in 20 years. Basically I’m trying to identify a path to follow to ensure that my skills stay relevant in this period, keep me employed and fairly well payed, and hopefully interested!

How are you all navigating this with so many paths to follow?

Thanks!",unsure what skills to focus on for future job security i m mainly network operations background i fell into a security engineer role. primarily i m managing firewalls some siem involvement indirectly through our soc some incident response playbook and siem rule design. a little bit of firewall rule auditing and governance stuff. but other than the firewalls it s all very shallow knowledge as i m not involved deep enough. i feel like my network skills are falling away now due to lack of use and i don t know whether to keep them fresh. certs like ccnp are due to expire soon. i have my firewall skills and certs which are my primary skill. but i feel like this will only carry me so far who s to say firewalls as we know them will still be prominent in a few more years. i dabbled with some red team stuff recently tried some htb challenges which highlighted my absolute lack of knowledge in this area. so i m gravitating towards more blue team skills as this is more my strength at the moment. but should i gain some more red team skills then operations in general sysadmin type work i still gravitate towards this area too mainly due to familiarity of being in operations for so long. and i m reluctant to abandon the network skills but i wonder it s holding me back trying to maintain this. basically i feel like my exposure and skills to all these areas is too shallow and that i need to focus more. i m approaching late   s not a spring chicken anymore. in an ideal world i d love to retire or at least reduce my hours in    years. basically i m trying to identify a path to follow to ensure that my skills stay relevant in this period keep me employed and fairly well payed and hopefully interested how are you all navigating this with so many paths to follow thanks,1,1,1805,1776,2024,5,Wednesday,12,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1cxzg4x/unsure_what_skills_to_focus_on_for_future_job/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1cxzg4x/unsure_what_skills_to_focus_on_for_future_job/,1,0.40732279173060193,0.5926772082693981,SVM (Linear)

I'll preface this by saying I currently reside in a Network security / Security architect role which at a high level consists of network security device administration and designing networks.

I'm not sure how many topics really overlap between the two, I'm torn because I feel perhaps having defensive experience would allow access to a wider job market but at the same time would I be wasting time learning the likes of blue tooling which I'd probably not use.

I also have late diagnosed ADHD and seem to have extreme trouble settling on anything (especially which cert to pick)

* This country seems to have some level of expectation that you grind helpdesk or some sort of support role before you're worthy, here I am.
* This country seems to be rewarding IT degrees and community college certificates over actual cyber certs more and more (used to be different IMO) - I'm going off job ads to come to this conclusion.
* There's a general sentiment that you should also grind sysadmin, therefore leading me down the Microsoft sysadmin cert path grind. There are a ton of certs and it's hard to choose. I don't know if I should be doing this.

I also don't know if I should be doing this as there isn't much room to move up in this company and there's no guarantee I'll ever use 365 again.
* It looks very difficult to land a pentesting role straight off the bat (low amount of pentesting jobs advertised here), so I would likely have to aim for SoC Analyst first.

Should I just go straight for OSCP and ignore everything else",certificate chasing paralysis. background: wanted to be a pentester from the first time i heard about wep hacking and haven t really changed since. i should say that i do have some experience in hacking and broad surface level knowledge of pentesting just from reading so much about it over the years. now:    yo working as sole it support officer mainly with azuread     at a company of    with a tiny bit of security involved. i would say the role is verging on junior sysadmin if not already. there isn t a whole lot of room to move up in this company besides grinding ms certs to play around with what i ve learned with those. i really want to get into cyber but the path there isn t clear especially in this economic climate when the goalposts keep moving. i also have late diagnosed adhd and seem to have extreme trouble settling on anything this country seems to have some level of expectation that you grind helpdesk or some sort of support role before you re worthy here i am. this country seems to be rewarding it degrees and community college certificates over actual cyber certs more and more   i m going off job ads to come to this conclusion. there s a general sentiment that you should also grind sysadmin therefore leading me down the microsoft sysadmin cert path grind. there are a ton of certs and it s hard to choose. i don t know if i should be doing this. there s also a bit of pressure from things i don t know too much about at work e.g some basic     admin center stuff     exchange stuff     defender stuff. there are also a ton of certs for this and it s hard to choose. i also don t know if i should be doing this as there isn t much room to move up in this company and there s no guarantee i ll ever use     again. it looks very difficult to land a pentesting role straight off the bat so i would likely have to aim for soc analyst first. this sounds kind of pathetic but i need you guys and girls to set me on a clear path as i keep getting distracted by the billion certs out there. should i just go straight for oscp and ignore everything else,0,3,2219,2074,2024,5,Wednesday,1,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1d30a72/certificate_chasing_paralysis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1d30a72/certificate_chasing_paralysis/,1,0.45394558314321815,0.5460544168567818,SVM (Linear)

I’ve been with the company less than a year, there’s about 50 employees, and in that time 3-4 people a month have either quit or gotten fired. It’s a revolving door company with c suite executives that are full of hot heads, which is why the workload is so high since no one sticks around long enough to become proficient at what they do and having to constantly train new hires.

I really want to hold this job title with a different company and the pay raise was nice. 

Question: How long do I hold onto to this job and be miserable before applying other places or risk being fired for “under performing” or accidentally pissing off c suites. In my opinion, being fired is way harder to explain than wanting to leave shortly after being promoted. I’ve never felt so on eggshells with a company, because I’ve seen even the top performers get fired for voicing their opinions on how processes can be improved to decrease workloads.

1d66ow2,cybersecurity,ParticularAnt5424,2024-06-02 06:06:40,1717308400,Practical Skills over Certificate Grind,"We were recently looking for a junior and a senior security engineer. I was part of the interview process as a senior team member and found that certification matters very little and, in some cases, can even hurt your evaluation. Certifications will get you the interviews, but here are the highlights we encountered:
1. A person has multiple AWS certificates, but when we ask questions related to AWS - no answers.
2. A person has a Security+ cert but can't answer questions about CSRF and SSRF.

Maybe we were unlucky to encounter these folks, but thinking about it, I concluded that if you do not apply your skills, your knowledge fades, and those certificates mean nothing or can even hurt you. I wouldn’t ask about some advanced AWS topics if I didn’t see the AWS cert to test the knowledge.

My recommendation:
Certificates should be taken only to improve your knowledge, not to gain it. Any IT-related experience is, in most cases, ten times more valuable than a certificate. If you don’t have the experience to apply certificate-related skills, apply your skills with personal projects. For example, if you have AWS Security/Solutions Architect/Whatever certificates and don’t actually have work experience with AWS, build your own complicated infrastructure with CloudFormation/Terraform and reflect that in resume. This way, you learn IaC, apply your knowledge, and may remember things better than ""learn it for the exam and forget the next day""

This might be a bit of a hot take, but people spend money on certificates and avoid using paid services to learn practical things. You will never learn by just reading and grinding multiple-choice questions. You HAVE TO apply your knowledge. 
I have a friend working with audio, and he laughs at how ""cheap"" it is for my profession to use paid tools to gain knowledge. He spends so much more on essential tools that it’s not even comparable.","Practical Skills over Certificate Grind

I've been working full time at a University in the IT department as a Service Desk Technician Tier II for the last 10+ months, three weeks ago, received a promotion to Tech Support Specialist Tier II. 

During my time, I would troubleshoot network related issues, make Powershell scripts, handle virtual machine setups for students, and remediate a lot of endpoints off our network through reimaging, data restoration, and collaboration with our Information Security team(they'd isolate it off the network to an unauthenticated domain). 

As a student, I did an internship with them and realized I really enjoy information security, especially after handling so many remediation tickets working in service desk. 

The manager over that department was a mentor, and recently moved forward with another opportunity. Our two security analyst and Infosec engineer are currently out of the office for most of June, leaving no one but the Ciso to monitor our SIEM and take action for any incidents. 

I was recently asked to help out as a temporary SOC Analyst with my primary duties while the others were away for the meantime, and have access to our SIEM and MS Defender with alerts setup .

As it turns out, though, as far as years spent at the company, I've got seniority over everyone there, and because of that, while I'm still new and learning how to be effective in Cybersecurity, the other more senior Analysts have started coming to me simply because of the institutional knowledge I've built over the course of my time in my prior, from things like naming standards to which teams manage whatsystems, etc.

That's all fine and dandy; I'm thrilled to have something to offer, after all.

The catch to it all, though, and why I need to fill these gaps in the first place is that out SOC is apparently more insular than I'd have thought. They try to avoid reaching out to other teams and experts unless they've got no other choice(and sometimes not even then), preferring to look through hundreds of logs and spending notable amounts of times working an alert that might have been solved in a fraction of the time had they reached out.

Naturally, I asked, and they say it's because every alert is treated as if it were an insider threat. Obviously, they're not, of course. Nearly every alert we get is ultimately benign.

A fair majority of everything I know about our systems and policies comes from reaching out and making friends with as many of the other teams as I could manage, so being told to avoid that kind of thing just feels bizzare to me.

1d7q8g3,cybersecurity,R3ICR,2024-06-04 06:09:36,1717481376,Really Struggling As a SOC Analyst,"Hey guys, I've been a SOC analyst at a small MSSP for about three months now. Overall, the environment here seems fairly toxic with a lot of politics, shit talking, general lack of empathy for others, etc. I work overnights so I share an overlap with the morning shift (0500-1300) and mids (1500 - 2300). These two shifts have been at each other's throats over the most mundane shit. The morning shift person will come in and start trashing the mid shift's tickets for minor mistakes and complain to me about them.

She obviously does not like these two guys, but I have to hear this constant venting over what I consider to be the most minimal mistakes that could easily be corrected with a brief talk. It just feels immature to criticize people like that for their mistakes (like to the point where you're calling them stupid losers for it, grow the fuck up). One time the days person logged into slack at like 1 AM just to look through all of the tickets (she's a tier one who's been here for 6 months longer than I have btw, not any kind of management role) and found mistakes in one of the mids guys tickets and asked me to correct it for them, and then proceeded to bitch at the guy for the mistake he made. In this case the mistake was not great, he logged a ticket action instead of sending an email to the customer... but like the entire thing seemed like she was just taking out frustration on someone she disliked rather than some genuine good-faith attempt at correcting a mistake. 

They also talk about politics (everyone here except me is a conservative it seems) and they'll just say some crazy ass bigoted shit to eachother, like how my manager said Kanye ended up being right about Jews because of what's going on in Israel. During training he worked with me on overnights to provide support and every day he would be playing podcasts featuring Tucker Carlson. Regardless of how you feel about politics; I don't see why you have to force them onto somebody that hasn't talked about politics at all with you. Just put on some normal ass Chris Williamson shit or an infosec podcast and be done with it. Also, during training he talked about some kid at his daughters' school killing themselves because of bullying and followed it up with ""Kids these days are fucking pussies."" This really bothered me b/c of my mental health past. I can tell you for a fact people who kill themselves are experiencing an overwhelming amount of suffering and fight against their every survival instinct to carry out the act. They are not ""fucking pussies""

The mid shift is fine. But they always tell me about the changes that the company is going to make like how they're going to start installing cameras in the SOC, how the manager is going to start making fake SIEM events that we're expected to find and investigate to prove that we're going into the SIEM at all ( which is another can of worms. I have yet to find a single potential true-positive, all of the alerts are repeated false-positives that just haven't been tuned at all. How am I supposed to comb through the 1200 incidents that popped up over the past two hours when a quick cursory look at the investigation shows me that all traffic was dropped or it was just the customer's domain controller doing domain controller shit?) 

My daily work consists of waiting for network devices to experience outages, acknowledge the alerts for them, contacting the customer... and that's the meat of it. I'll also go through the EDR and handle the alerts for a few customers we have per night, only for those same false-positives to show up for other customers. Like why is AdobeCC constantly showing up in our EDR dashboard? It comes back as inconclusive each time, and usually the behavior that it's tying it to is like, a file write attempt or something (I honestly have no idea how to even really analyze the events. It seems like I'm expected to do a quick analysis, handle the event and move on. We never really went super in-depth into our tools during our training, but certain tools like FortiEDR just seem like they lack any sort of depth.)

I do have bad habits, like I'll put off the EDR events till the end of the day and do other shift during the night shift. I didn't used to do that, but at this point I just feel this black-hole in my stomach that sucks out all meaning from my life when I look at the EDR dashboard. I'm so sick of flagging OneLaunch.exe as malicious and deleting it from a device, I'm so sick of the same four applications populating our dashboard. I feel like I'm not really learning anything here either, because I'm the only one on the night shift and don't get to interact with the T2s and management (although from what mid-shift tells me it's not like they learn much from them anymway, the T2 we have is stand-offish because he got upset that the newbies had to share his desk and like, moved some shit on it or something.) I also hate touching the SIEM because I feel like I don't know how to do any meaningful work in there and I'm kind of just expected to figure it out. I don't think that's a huuuge issue in and of itself, but the SIEM configuration just seems so shitty. I wish I could show somebody, I will also admit that this is also a skill issue though. 

This whole thing feels like a dog-and-pony show with a collection of fake ass people that never matured past high-school. I kind of hate it here. I don't know what to do though, SOC positions in my area are dry and there isn't very many of them. This was the first and only infosec job I could find since I had to quit my last one. I feel like I can't really find a new job right now. What should I do? Stick it out for ~ a year and jump ship to a better opportunity? 

Sorry for this massive dump. I just don't know man, like this shit is exhausting. This company seems to keep giving me active reasons to dislike them, or maybe I'm just overreacting. ","Really Struggling As a SOC Analyst

I'll be honest. I think the main reason for my current predicament is that I have no real passion for tech/cyber. I don't do it in my free time.

I actually was working with the same company during my last year for the same role(which looking back it’s crazy they gave a job like that to an undergrad) but lurking here and thinking about my job it’s definitely not an entry level job. 

I feel guilt about this and feeling like I don’t belong at my job after looking at the sub (makes me also appreciate the job I have). Kinda why I’m getting my masters so I can keep up and play around during labs. 

Don’t get me wrong I like the job and think my degree did help me prepare for my job. I don’t get paid as much for a HCOL (at least compared to everyone who’s in Tech) but it’s probably because of the lack of experience when I graduated. Does anyone here have advice as to what next steps career wise could look like? I have a potential interview with TikTok but it’s for a similar position and I feel weird about it but I also would like to have an increase in pay at some point. Anyways ty for reading

1d89n30,cybersecurity,growlingpenguin,2024-06-04 22:06:39,1717538799,Low maturity level of SOC at a new company worries me,"I recently left my previous job in cybersecurity to join a promising opportunity at a new company. The people seem nice, as they were in the interviews, too, but after working in the position for a little while, the truth is dawning on me. I'm working as a senior specialist on the operational side, with a background in IR/analysis/detection engineering/monitoring infrastructures/all things technical, and everywhere I look I see gaping deficiencies. Despite the throwaway account, I don't want to go into specifics, but the overall level of maturity of the SOC is very low, especially when it comes to automation and processes. The way I see it, these are the bare minimums that need to be put in place in a modern MSSP SOC before anything ""extra"" can be added, as the work of all analysts and specialists working within the SOC suffers immensely from the disorganized nature of the work at this point in time. I also think that because of this, the level of service we can provide to our customers is subpar.

Because I work on the operational side of things, I most likely won't have the final say on how tools or processes are built in the future, which leaves me somewhat worried. As I said, the people are welcoming and willing to listen to my ideas, but at the same time seeing how little they've managed to develop the operations over the years leading up to this point is... alarming. The chaotic global situation and budget cuts don't leave me hopeful about getting any more resources to work on the things that would need fixing, so the way I see it is that either the things are handled ""eventually"", swept under the rug, or fixed by some poor sod without appropriate pay.

The reason why I'm bringing this up is to ask from you about your experiences. Have you faced similar issues in the past and how did you handle them? Did you take it up to the manager(s) or people responsible of the architecture, or did you fix things by yourself? I'm debating whether or not I should stay and see how things progress in the future, or start looking for a new job. I knew that I wasn't walking into a perfect SOC where everything would be fine and dandy, but truth to be told, this is somewhat baffling. ","Low maturity level of SOC at a new company worries me

I also think that because of this, the level of service we can provide to our customers is subpar.

Because I work on the operational side of things, I most likely won't have the final say on how tools or processes are built in the future, which leaves me somewhat worried. As I said, the people are welcoming and willing to listen to my ideas, but at the same time seeing how little they've managed to develop the operations over the years leading up to this point is... alarming. The chaotic global situation and budget cuts don't leave me hopeful about getting any more resources to work on the things that would need fixing, so the way I see it is that either the things are handled ""eventually"", swept under the rug, or fixed by some poor sod without appropriate pay.

The reason why I'm bringing this up is to ask from you about your experiences. Have you faced similar issues in the past and how did you handle them? Did you take it up to the manager(s) or people responsible of the architecture, or did you fix things by yourself? I'm debating whether or not I should stay and see how things progress in the future, or start looking for a new job.

I work at a small MSSP, 1 vCISO, 1 security architect, 1 engineer and 2 analysts that supports around 8 enterprises (in various sectors) with around 10k users total. All of the organizations use M365 (Office, Entra, Intune, Defender) and I am in charge and the main point of contact for all incidents and issues with any of our service (security related or not) and responsible for planning, deploying, updating, and supporting all configs and maintaining all documentation.

This includes Defender for Endpoint, cloud apps, Identity, Sentinel, Azure, Admin portal, Intune, Entra ID, Cisco Meraki, Cisco endpoint protection, Carbon Black, MDR portal, logic apps automation, conditional access, and others.

I also am in charge of our threat Analysts, assigning them responsibilities, creating and maintaining playbooks for them to follow, leading incident response, training them, and assisting with their day to day alert response (all alerts from the security tools are sent to our messaging tool for the analysts to review). On top of that I was tasked with redesigning and automating all analysts tasks and responsibilities with Sentinel.

Along with that I am the person anyone calls when there are any issues with anything even remotely related to any of the above and really struggling with no support from Microsoft support or vendors.

I was leading all meetings till I broke down and couldn't deal with the additional stress of architecting and pitching all of the above with the different enterprises IT admins and c suite, which can be very difficult when you are young and people do not respect your knowledge or opinion.

My company has a security architect that does not want to deal with Microsoft products, leaving all of that responsibility to me.

Am I crazy or is this an insane amount of workload for one person in a MSSP that is pushing all clients to full M365 for security? All enterprises are onboard with this but some admins and techs do not like Microsoft leading them to troubleshoot issues for 5 minutes before sending it to me.

My main issue is the lack of support from the top levels of my org and the enterprises we service making all the above even more difficult to track and maintain configs and issues across 8 enterprises by myself.","Security Engineer burnout

TL;DR - I am progressing in the Cyber Security industry steadily whilst having NO certifications.

For a bit of context:

I have been working in a SOC for just over 2 years now. Having moved into security from a Tech Support/Networking role that I had done for 3 years prior, so 5 years in the IT industry total.

I am mid 30's and before working in IT I worked in Precious Metals.

My first security role was a standard SOC analyst L1, monitoring alerts and determining what needed escalating and/or identifying opportunities for tuning for the L2/3's to perform to somewhat lighten our load... (it never ends).

A year after that I moved into a role where the sole focus of the team was tuning out the false positives (sort of SOC L1.5) and dealing with a huge backlog the company had as they absolutely took on more work than they had staff to handle. Also, working with the Product Support Engineering team on projects such as updating client SIEM instances etc.

Fast forward another year and I am getting interviews for full SOC L2 roles and getting offers that I am considering. 

I do NOT have a single Certification and making steady progress in the industry just by having the aptitude to learn and a catalogue of projects worked on. 

Does this experience weigh more heavily than certifications for some hiring managers/companies or have I just been extremely lucky with my Cyber Security journey so far?","How Much Do Cyber Certs Actually Matter?

1dcw4dj,cybersecurity,motion_seaker,2024-06-10 20:46:03,1718052363,My journey to securing a remote entry level Cybersecurity job with no prior Cyber experience and < 1 year of IT experience,"**TLDR at the bottom.**

Hello,

I just got a remote Cybersecruity job with no prior Cyber experience and less than 1 year of IT experience. I'm in my very early 20's, and this would be a 30% pay raise from my previous IT role.

I wanted to make a post for a couple reasons: 1. To describe what I did to prepare myself for the job hunt 2. The job hunt itself. 3. My perspective on the current state of the job hunting and my advice to help people who are looking for get a job. 4. For entertainment, educational, and journaling purposes (my life goal is to be an author lol).

**1. What I did to prepare myself for the job hunt.**

I dropped out of college.

I was in school for nursing and I never really studied in HS. I never had to truly study for anything in my life, and nursing 1 classes changed that very quickly. I didn't know how to study, and because of that I started failing my classes. Instead of failing out, I chose to drop out of my nursing classes and spent the rest of the semester finishing my gen-ed classes.

I then started working at a nursing home, and then a hospital. Both jobs were fine enough, but I realized  
that this really wasn't what I wanted to do with the rest of my life. One day, I was on scrolling on tiktok when I saw one of those cyber influencers telling me how I could ""make 90,000$ a year while working in the Bahamas"".

Even posting this from an anonymous account, it feels embarrassing to admit that this video sold me.

**A. I addressed my mental health.**

I have autism.

I was diagnosed when I was two, but my parents only told me when I was a sophomore in HS. One of the big side effects from this is that I did *not* like to think about my mental status (since I didn't really grow up with the fact that I have autism, i really don't like acknowledging I have it. I think I might mentally acknowledge it to myself once a month. I feel like if I do truly acknowledge it, i can then use that as an excuse to do nothing with my life. Even writing this section felt very uncomfortable for me.). The occasional time I ever felt ""mentally wrong"", I would just blame it on the autism and move on with my day.

However, failing out of school made me revaluate things. I went to a psychiatrist and he said that I had pretty bad ADHD and he had no idea how I made it through HS without the slightest inclination that something could be wrong ([my genuine reaction to that information](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/002/542/261/7a1.jpg)). Annoyance aside, he threw me some Adderall and it improved my life drastically. With a renewed determination, and some addys in hand, it was time to get to work.

**B. I enrolled at WGU (Westerns Governors University).**

If you have engaged in the Cybersec community, its possible you may have heard of WGU before. You might  
have have also seen their ads on tv before (its the one with the owl). WGU is a online, non-profit, nationally-accredited university.

WGU is different from typical universities, as instead of paying for individual courses that make up a term, you pay for time slot of 6 months. You can complete as many courses as you'd like, or do as little courses as you'd like.

I absolutely love WGU. It has completely changed my life for the better. [WGU's cyber program](https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-bachelors-program.html) offers 10 certificates (WGU says its 15 but 5 of those certs are basically not real, as they are certs you get when you get multiple certs. For example, you get the CompTIA IT Operations Specialist certification when you get the A+ cert and the Network+ cert.) that are i*ncluded* in the tuition price. So if you graduate, you will have a degree from a national accredited university and industry recognized certificates. As much as I love glazing WGU, lets move on with my journey.

As soon as I enrolled, I got a job as a home aid using my prior health care experience. My home aid job allowed me to to study *at work* for 7 hours a day, as patients only really needed work done for one hour and mostly needed the convince of someone being around for the the rest of the time. In 8 months, I got done over 50% of my courses for the four year program, something that would not be possible in a traditional school.

There is a lot of positive things (and some negative things) about WGU I'm leaving out, so if you have any questions feel free to DM or comment. 

**C. I got a IT helpdesk job.**

This step sucked.

Through my research I quickly discovered that if I expected to just graduate and get a cybersecurity  
job with no problems, I would be in for a rude awakening. Most people recommended to get into helpdesk as a good entry point, so I did school until I got my A+ certification (which is the industry standard entry level IT  
certification) and started applying.

It took me 389 applications. At the time, I thought this was insane, but comparatively its actually not bad at all. I've seen some people put in 1000+ and still be searching. Interviewing was a relatively new thing for me. In health care you'll get hired if you have a pulse, while in IT I got ghosted after a a fourth round in person interview for a huge company in the city. After going into the city. After paying a 10$ parking fee.

Cory, if your reading this, I hope your pillow stays warm at night.

Luckily for me, the job I ended up getting in the end was probably one of the best ones I applied to. The pay was higher then average, and the job was very easy, so I spent most of my time there studying. I also got the chance to complete do multiple security projects, which looked quite nice on the resume.

**D. I networked and** **attended local meetings.**

This step sucked worse.

Through further research, I learned that the best way way to get a job is to know a guy. It also looks good on your resume if your apart of some cybersecurity groups.

  
I really didn't want to do this, as I was already working full time and in school full time at this point. I also haven't really been socially active since covid, as covid really change my life for the worst. I used to enjoy going out but covid left me in a bad place physically and mentally. The only people I talked to were my family, and my very close friends.

However, I knew that if I wanted to better myself, eventually I would have to go outside and touch some grass. I looked up popular cybersec groups in my area and I went to two of them. 

The first one was formal. you would network before the meeting, a sponsor would give a presentation on why you should buy their product, and then it was over. I didn't particularly care for this one so much, as there wasn't really to much time to network. Everyone was also way older then me, which definitely made it harder to  connect with people in such a formal environment. You have to pay a yearly membership fee aswell.

The second one was informal and meets at a bar in the city. They had a discord group which I joined, and started talking to people from there. I posted my resume in the career advice channel, and I immediately got invited to a voice call where two people critiqued it. After critiquing it, they said it was overall pretty decent, as I had 5 months of IT work experience, some good certs under my belt, was active in some security groups, and in school for cybersecurity. They told me that they will keep my resume if anything came up. I also went to their physical meetup and it was great. It was very nice to know they I still had it in me to make friends from strangers, something I couldn't have done 8 months ago. The steps I was taking to improve my self were paying off.

I also went to an annual cybersec conference in the city, I already knew some people from my other groups, and that was a cool experience.

With all these steps being completed or in progress, its time to talk about the job hunt.

  
**2. The job hunt itself.**

I got lucky.

  
So lucky. Stupid lucky. So lucky I should have bought a lotto ticket. I mean, your going to need some luck with any job hunt you do, but this was something else entirely.

About a month ago, I get a DM from the guy I was on the discord call with about my resume. He was leaving his current position and referred me to the hiring manager. While I appreciated the gesture, I didn't think much of it, as my resume had to to be good enough to get a call back. I'm a pessimistic guy (especially after my last job hunt) and assumed the worse. 

About four hours later, I get a email from HR asking if we can schedule an interview.

While doing all the steps before this moment contributed to this interview invite (Step A allowed me to for steps B, C, and D to occur. Step B and C allowed for my resume to be good enough to get an invite. Step D allowed for the opportunity to get the invite in the first place, as without step D the person who referred me would not know I existed in the first place.), It was still very lucky that he left his position in the first place, and it was very lucky that he referred me.

With that being said, luck can only take you so far. It was time to execute from this point forward or ""lock in"" as my fellow zoomers would say. 

By this point, I was pretty good with interviews. The HR screening interview went perfectly. We had a great connection, and I did flawlessly on the few technical questions that were asked. The HR person even scheduled my next interview during the middle of the interview. The next interview was with the director of cybersecurity operations. It was an 1 hour long, with 45 minutes of straight technical questions.

I'm going to post the ones I remember below, just to shed some light on what technical questions you could potentially see in some of these interviews:

1. Identify the following ports. (20, 21, 22, 23, 53, 80, 443, 3389)

2. What are the two types of encryption? 

3. What's TCP?

4. What's UDP?

5. How does DNS work?

6. Does DNS use TCP or UDP?

7. What's the MITRE attack framework?

8. What's the cyber kill chain? 

9. Why would you use hashing? 

10. Can hashing be reversed? 

11. What's the difference between a firewall deny rule vs a firewall drop rule?

12. What is a brute force attack and how can you mitigate it?

13. Name the two most common vulnerability scanners.

14. What is a MITM attack and how can you mitigate it?

15. What is a SQL injection attack and how can you mitigate it?

16. What is the difference between a SIEM and an EDR?

I got 13/16 of these questions right (6 is a trick question, 8 I got half right and I bricked on question 7). I also tried to go the extra mile and give examples/scenarios when I could. I thought the interview went good/decent. We had good conversations but it was hard to get a good read on the guy. I also felt I did quite poorly on the behavioral questions that were asked, so I expected the worse.

The very next day, the HR person called me and gave me an offer.

In only 14 months, from the start of my enrollment at WGU to this point, my hard work had finally paid off.

**3. My perspective on the current state of the job market and my advice to help people who are looking for a job.**

This section will probably be controversial. The following section is simply my opinion.

**A. My perspective on the current state of the job market.**

  
If you spent all your time in this subreddit, you would think that you must work at an IT helpdesk for 1.5 centuries before even thinking about being worthy to so much as apply for a cyber role.

If you spent all your time on cyber tiktok, you would would think that simply getting the Google cybersecurity course on Coursera qualifies you to be a CISO at a fortune 500 company.

The truth, in all things, lies somewhere in the middle (with the scale pointing a bit to the left in this subreddit's favor.).

  
It is not an easy market. However, if you have the skills, the proof that you have the skills, sheer willpower, a good network, and some luck on your side, **you will find an opportunity.**

**B. My advice to help people who are looking for a job.**

You can find a lot of sources on how to get cyber jobs, certs for different sub paths, etc. I have listed some tips I've personally used to my advantage.

**1. Shoot the damn ball (apply to everything that your interested in).**

I used to get caught up in job descriptions of jobs that interested me, and pass up applying to a job if I didn't  meet exactly what they were looking for ( EX: I didn't have a certain certification they were looking for, they required 3+ years of cyber exp when I had 0 years exp, etc.). The consequence to this is that I only applied to a few jobs a day, and the jobs I did apply to were almost impossible to get, as the standards were lower so more people applied to them.

One day, I was catching up with my friend who was on leave from the marines. We were at a park and he went up to this women, who was way out of his league, and got her number. I have a hard time trying to talk to strangers, much less do something like that. I asked him how he gets his confidence. His response?

  
""Shooters shoot.""

He was right. I needed stop thinking about if I was taking a high percentage shot and just shoot the damn ball.  Weather the shot was under the basket (it helpdesk) or from outside the arena (CISO of google). To get a job, all you need is one place to say yes. The more applications you put in, the higher chance a place will say yes.

I started doing this and got more interviews. Even if I didn't get the job, this let me practice for interviews. It was also an amazing networking opportunity, as you get to talk to employers in your desired field and get on a first name basis. These interviews can also be a great opportunity to get other positions as well. For example, companies would tell me ""I don't think you meet the qualifications for the pentesting position, but we we have SOC opening that I think you could be a good fit for!"". The prior example happened to me 3 times.

**2. Put a face to the name.**

When you apply to position, from the employers perspective, you are just name in a system. A name on an application that gets run to through an AI screening software that bases if your qualified for the position on keywords in your resume. 

When you apply to a role your particularly interested in, it is worth the effort to reach out personally to the hiring manger/recruiter. Its harder to send some one an ""Unfortunately"" email when the candidate connected with you on linked in and messaged you saying ""I'm looking forward to to this opportunity Ｏ(≧∇≦)Ｏ"". In case you the recruiter doesn't immediately give you the job based on that message, it's another good way to establish relationships with employers in your field of interest.

  
**3. Leverage any resource you have to your advantage.**

By 'any' resource, I mean any resource. Your friends mom works in HR at company of interest? Ask her if there's an opening. Linked In allows 100 free connections a week? Connect with as many cyber recruiters and people who work in your dream jobs as possible. Message them and and ask for tha ""15 min coffee chat"" those linked in warriors always talk about (as annoying as it is and as uncomfortable as it to ask to meet with a random stranger, putting a voice to a name is even better then putting a face to a name.). You have a phone? Start calling calling companies in your area and see if they have openings.

Use as many resources as you can to maximize your job hunt.

  
If you are still reading this, I appreciate the time you took to read this. I hope I have given you tips you can use, or have entertained you at the very least.

Fell free to DM me with any questions :)

  
**TLDR**

1. Make sure your are mentally prepared and healthy.

2. Acquire skills (weather that's through education or certifications).

3. Network with others in the space.

4. Optimize your job hunt using relevant tips in tricks.

5. Do not give up.

6. Get lucky.","My journey to securing a remote entry level Cybersecurity job with no prior Cyber experience and < 1 year of IT experience

While I appreciated the gesture, I didn't think much of it, as my resume had to to be good enough to get a call back. I'm a pessimistic guy (especially after my last job hunt) and assumed the worse. 

About four hours later, I get a email from HR asking if we can schedule an interview.

While doing all the steps before this moment contributed to this interview invite (Step A allowed me to for steps B, C, and D to occur. Step B and C allowed for my resume to be good enough to get an invite. Step D allowed for the opportunity to get the invite in the first place, as without step D the person who referred me would not know I existed in the first place.), It was still very lucky that he left his position in the first place, and it was very lucky that he referred me.

With that being said, luck can only take you so far. It was time to execute from this point forward or ""lock in"" as my fellow zoomers would say. 

By this point, I was pretty good with interviews. The HR screening interview went perfectly. We had a great connection, and I did flawlessly on the few technical questions that were asked. The HR person even scheduled my next interview during the middle of the interview. The next interview was with the director of cybersecurity operations. It was an 1 hour long, with 45 minutes of straight technical questions.

I'm going to post the ones I remember below, just to shed some light on what technical questions you could potentially see in some of these interviews:

1. Identify the following ports. (20, 21, 22, 23, 53, 80, 443, 3389)

2. What are the two types of encryption? 

3. What's TCP?

4. What's UDP?

5. How does DNS work?

6. Does DNS use TCP or UDP?

7. What's the MITRE attack framework?

8. What's the cyber kill chain? 

9. Why would you use hashing? 

10. Can hashing be reversed? 

11. What's the difference between a firewall deny rule vs a firewall drop rule?

12. What is a brute force attack and how can you mitigate it?

13. Name the two most common vulnerability scanners.

14. What is a MITM attack and how can you mitigate it?

15. What is a SQL injection attack and how can you mitigate it?

16. What is the difference between a SIEM and an EDR?

I got 13/16 of these questions right (6 is a trick question, 8 I got half right and I bricked on question 7). I also tried to go the extra mile and give examples/scenarios when I could. I thought the interview went good/decent. We had good conversations but it was hard to get a good read on the guy. I also felt I did quite poorly on the behavioral questions that were asked, so I expected the worse.

The very next day, the HR person called me and gave me an offer.

In only 14 months, from the start of my enrollment at WGU to this point, my hard work had finally paid off.

**3. My perspective on the current state of the job market and my advice to help people who are looking for a job.**

This section will probably be controversial. The following section is simply my opinion.

**A. My perspective on the current state of the job market.**

  
If you spent all your time in this subreddit, you would think that you must work at an IT helpdesk for 1.5 centuries before even thinking about being worthy to so much as apply for a cyber role.

If you spent all your time on cyber tiktok, you would would think that simply getting the Google cybersecurity course on Coursera qualifies you to be a CISO at a fortune 500 company.

The truth, in all things, lies somewhere in the middle (with the scale pointing a bit to the left in this subreddit's favor.).

  
It is not an easy market. However, if you have the skills, the proof that you have the skills, sheer willpower, a good network, and some luck on your side, **you will find an opportunity.**

**B. My advice to help people who are looking for a job.**

You can find a lot of sources on how to get cyber jobs, certs for different sub paths, etc. I have listed some tips I've personally used to my advantage.

**1. Shoot the damn ball (apply to everything that your interested in).**

I used to get caught up in job descriptions of jobs that interested me, and pass up applying to a job if I didn't  meet exactly what they were looking for ( EX: I didn't have a certain certification they were looking for, they required 3+ years of cyber exp when I had 0 years exp, etc.). The consequence to this is that I only applied to a few jobs a day, and the jobs I did apply to were almost impossible to get, as the standards were lower so more people applied to them.

One day, I was catching up with my friend who was on leave from the marines. We were at a park and he went up to this women, who was way out of his league, and got her number. I have a hard time trying to talk to strangers, much less do something like that. I asked him how he gets his confidence. His response?

  
""Shooters shoot.""

He was right. I needed stop thinking about if I was taking a high percentage shot and just shoot the damn ball.  Weather the shot was under the basket (it helpdesk) or from outside the arena (CISO of google). To get a job, all you need is one place to say yes. The more applications you put in, the higher chance a place will say yes.

I started doing this and got more interviews. Even if I didn't get the job, this let me practice for interviews. It was also an amazing networking opportunity, as you get to talk to employers in your desired field and get on a first name basis. These interviews can also be a great opportunity to get other positions as well. For example, companies would tell me ""I don't think you meet the qualifications for the pentesting position, but we we have SOC opening that I think you could be a good fit for!"". The prior example happened to me 3 times.

**2. Put a face to the name.**

When you apply to position, from the employers perspective, you are just name in a system. A name on an application that gets run to through an AI screening software that bases if your qualified for the position on keywords in your resume. 

When you apply to a role your particularly interested in, it is worth the effort to reach out personally to the hiring manger/recruiter. Its harder to send some one an ""Unfortunately"" email when the candidate connected with you on linked in and messaged you saying ""I'm looking forward to to this opportunity Ｏ(≧∇≦)Ｏ"". In case you the recruiter doesn't immediately give you the job based on that message, it's another good way to establish relationships with employers in your field of interest.

  
**3. Leverage any resource you have to your advantage.**

By 'any' resource, I mean any resource. Your friends mom works in HR at company of interest? Ask her if there's an opening. Linked In allows 100 free connections a week? Connect with as many cyber recruiters and people who work in your dream jobs as possible. Message them and and ask for tha ""15 min coffee chat"" those linked in warriors always talk about (as annoying as it is and as uncomfortable as it to ask to meet with a random stranger, putting a voice to a name is even better then putting a face to a name.). You have a phone? Start calling calling companies in your area and see if they have openings.

Use as many resources as you can to maximize your job hunt.

  
If you are still reading this, I appreciate the time you took to read this. I hope I have given you tips you can use, or have entertained you at the very least.

Fell free to DM me with any questions :)

  
**TLDR**

1. Make sure your are mentally prepared and healthy.

2. Acquire skills (weather that's through education or certifications).

3. Network with others in the space.

4. Optimize your job hunt using relevant tips in tricks.

5. Do not give up.

6. Get lucky.",my journey to securing a remote entry level cybersecurity job with no prior cyber experience and   year of it experience tldr at the bottom. hello i just got a remote cybersecruity job with no prior cyber experience and less than   year of it experience. i m in my very early    s and this would be a    pay raise from my previous it role. i wanted to make a post for a couple reasons:  . to describe what i did to prepare myself for the job hunt  . the job hunt itself.  . my perspective on the current state of the job hunting and my advice to help people who are looking for get a job.  . for entertainment educational and journaling purposes .  . what i did to prepare myself for the job hunt. i dropped out of college. i was in school for nursing and i never really studied in hs. i never had to truly study for anything in my life and nursing   classes changed that very quickly. i didn t know how to study and because of that i started failing my classes. instead of failing out i chose to drop out of my nursing classes and spent the rest of the semester finishing my gen ed classes. i then started working at a nursing home and then a hospital. both jobs were fine enough but i realized that this really wasn t what i wanted to do with the rest of my life. one day i was on scrolling on tiktok when i saw one of those cyber influencers telling me how i could make        a year while working in the bahamas . even posting this from an anonymous account it feels embarrassing to admit that this video sold me. a. i addressed my mental health. i have autism. i was diagnosed when i was two but my parents only told me when i was a sophomore in hs. one of the big side effects from this is that i did not like to think about my mental status . the occasional time i ever felt mentally wrong i would just blame it on the autism and move on with my day. however failing out of school made me revaluate things. i went to a psychiatrist and he said that i had pretty bad adhd and he had no idea how i made it through hs without the slightest inclination that something could be wrong . wgu is a online non profit nationally accredited university. wgu is different from typical universities as instead of paying for individual courses that make up a term you pay for time slot of   months. you can complete as many courses as you d like or do as little courses as you d like. i absolutely love wgu. it has completely changed my life for the better. wgu s cyber program that are included in the tuition price. so if you graduate you will have a degree from a national accredited university and industry recognized certificates. as much as i love glazing wgu lets move on with my journey. as soon as i enrolled i got a job as a home aid using my prior health care experience. my home aid job allowed me to to study at work for   hours a day as patients only really needed work done for one hour and mostly needed the convince of someone being around for the the rest of the time. in   months i got done over    of my courses for the four year program something that would not be possible in a traditional school. there is a lot of positive things about wgu i m leaving out so if you have any questions feel free to dm or comment. c. i got a it helpdesk job. this step sucked. through my research i quickly discovered that if i expected to just graduate and get a cybersecurity job with no problems i would be in for a rude awakening. most people recommended to get into helpdesk as a good entry point so i did school until i got my a certification and started applying. it took me     applications. at the time i thought this was insane but comparatively its actually not bad at all. i ve seen some people put in      and still be searching. interviewing was a relatively new thing for me. in health care you ll get hired if you have a pulse while in it i got ghosted after a a fourth round in person interview for a huge company in the city. after going into the city. after paying a    parking fee. cory if your reading this i hope your pillow stays warm at night. luckily for me the job i ended up getting in the end was probably one of the best ones i applied to. the pay was higher then average and the job was very easy so i spent most of my time there studying. i also got the chance to complete do multiple security projects which looked quite nice on the resume. d. i networked and attended local meetings. this step sucked worse. through further research i learned that the best way way to get a job is to know a guy. it also looks good on your resume if your apart of some cybersecurity groups. i really didn t want to do this as i was already working full time and in school full time at this point. i also haven t really been socially active since covid as covid really change my life for the worst. i used to enjoy going out but covid left me in a bad place physically and mentally. the only people i talked to were my family and my very close friends. however i knew that if i wanted to better myself eventually i would have to go outside and touch some grass. i looked up popular cybersec groups in my area and i went to two of them. the first one was formal. you would network before the meeting a sponsor would give a presentation on why you should buy their product and then it was over. i didn t particularly care for this one so much as there wasn t really to much time to network. everyone was also way older then me which definitely made it harder to connect with people in such a formal environment. you have to pay a yearly membership fee aswell. the second one was informal and meets at a bar in the city. they had a discord group which i joined and started talking to people from there. i posted my resume in the career advice channel and i immediately got invited to a voice call where two people critiqued it. after critiquing it they said it was overall pretty decent as i had   months of it work experience some good certs under my belt was active in some security groups and in school for cybersecurity. they told me that they will keep my resume if anything came up. i also went to their physical meetup and it was great. it was very nice to know they i still had it in me to make friends from strangers something i couldn t have done   months ago. the steps i was taking to improve my self were paying off. i also went to an annual cybersec conference in the city i already knew some people from my other groups and that was a cool experience. with all these steps being completed or in progress its time to talk about the job hunt.  . the job hunt itself. i got lucky. so lucky. stupid lucky. so lucky i should have bought a lotto ticket. i mean your going to need some luck with any job hunt you do but this was something else

I'm in a bit of conundrum. I have two offers from two different companies for a SOC Analyst positions and I'm having a hard time picking which one I should work for.

The companies are SonicWall and Expel. SonicWall position pays less than Expel and a lot less than what I'm currently making but they have been in business for a long time. Plus they offer training for the first month, less hours in work week, and they hinted at fast enough progression.

Expel pays well, with total comp exceeding what I'm making now. They offer a four day work week and seem to have a really great culture without coming off as culty. They have a clear progression path for people joining but have not mentioned training. However they are a start up and had some layoffs last year. 

As I have a mortgage and other financial obligations I'm a bit nervous about the money SonicWall is offering but also nervous about Expels start up status.

My question is which of the companies would you choose and which one would be more impactful to have on my CV? I'm really struggling to choose and would dearly appreciate any help, insights or the like you guys could offer!

The companies are SonicWall and Expel. SonicWall position pays less than Expel and a lot less than what I'm currently making but they have been in business for a long time. Plus they offer training for the first month, less hours in work week, and they hinted at fast enough progression.

Expel pays well, with total comp exceeding what I'm making now. They offer a four day work week and seem to have a really great culture without coming off as culty. They have a clear progression path for people joining but have not mentioned training. However they are a start up and had some layoffs last year. 

As I have a mortgage and other financial obligations I'm a bit nervous about the money SonicWall is offering but also nervous about Expels start up status.

My question is which of the companies would you choose and which one would be more impactful to have on my CV? I'm really struggling to choose and would dearly appreciate any help, insights or the like you guys could offer!

I've now transitioned into information security, while also exploring conflict management, argumentation theory, psychology, and related fields. This has shaped my approach to be very human/employee-focused.

However, my official experience in information security is primarily academic. Although I've had some project management training, I have not held a position with budget responsibility—this was typically the client's domain.

As the title suggests, I've been invited to a job interview for a CISO position at a medium-sized corporation (about 2500 employees in 25 locations). The first interview was a Teams session with one of the CEOs, where I was transparent about my background.

Now, I've been invited to an in-person meeting, indicating that my skills are considered adequate for the job. However, I'm concerned that I might be taking on more than I can handle.

There is currently no official ISO or ISM framework in place, so I would be CISO by default. Fortunately, there is no immediate time pressure to achieve ISO 27001 certification. Nevertheless, the goal is to eventually position the company for ISO 27001 certification to satisfy clients.

From what I understand, I would have the support of top management and a long-time IT supplier. Despite this, the scale of the operation is intimidating, and I worry I may not have the necessary manpower.

My plan is to get to know the business and establish relationships with stakeholders. Since there is no asset management in place, I would rely on them to assist in creating one. This would be followed by a risk assessment in cooperation with stakeholders, and then drafting and implementing appropriate guidelines.

The largest challenge would be implementing the many requirements of ISO 27001. Even if I serve primarily as an advisor to other teams, it still feels like a significant task.

Should I pursue this opportunity if given the chance? I'm anxious, and not sure how much of this may be impostor syndrome.

The official start date would be in October at the earliest, giving me some time to prepare further.","From 0 to 100 — from network architect to CISO?

I’m writing an article on the job market and ROI for the CISSP and would love to hear from those of you in the trenches on how you perceive the certification. Your insights and experiences would be valuable for understanding the impact of this certification on job prospects, professional development and other factors.

Here are some questions to guide your responses, but feel free to share any thoughts you have:

1. General Impression: What is your overall impression of the CISSP certification? 
2. Evaluation of Data: Have you evaluated any data or metrics that show the benefits (or lack thereof) of having the CISSP certification, such as salary increases, job offers, or career advancement opportunities?
3. Career Goals: Have you felt thwarted in your career goals without the CISSP certification, and/or did obtaining it help you overcome these obstacles?
4. International Opportunities: If you have pursued opportunities in a different country, how has the CISSP certification impacted your job search and career prospects internationally?
5. Reasons for Pursuing: What were your main reasons for pursuing the CISSP certification? Were they based on personal ambition, employer requirements, or another factor?

Your responses will help provide a comprehensive and data driven view of the value of the CISSP certification from the perspective of those who know it best. Thank you in advance for your contributions!

I have some thoughts and questions that I wanted to address specifically to the pen-testers in the room, hoping to get some feedback.

I'm currently working as a Cybersecurity Administrator, primarily managing Palo Alto firewalls. I recently finished my Master’s in Cyber Security and hold multiple certifications (except for the OSCP). The point is that I'm fairly familiar with the security fundamentals, networking, IT basics, etc.

My main career goal is to pursue penetration testing, working in the red teaming space. I was wondering if I could get some advice on how I should move forward.

I've been spending more time on Hack The Box and TryHackMe, getting more familiar with the CTF space and the methodologies involved in offensive security. And I feel like there is much more for me to learn in the field, but I’m not sure how much of these CTF challenges make sense for me to do. (I don't think all pen-testers are expected to constantly get root access on HTB-level hard boxes, right?)

My main question is, does it make sense for me to continue to study and do these CTF challenges? If so, what might be some better suggestions or learning paths I should look into? Or is this not entirely relevant given my current position and something that I'll primarily learn on the job once I get into the role? Any feedback or suggestions would be much appreciated!","Pentesting Career Advice

Got offered a role today by a bigger company, pay is slightly less but I am negotiating to get at least the same; clear challenges with less areas to focus on so I'm hoping that equates to less stress and context switching, although slightly more travel.

I've been with my current employer for nearly 10 years, so I am a little anxious about moving on. I will lose my RSUs, but that's fine, I just can't handle the extreme context switching - I feel like Im not delivering quality as I don't have the time to focus properly, and that is becoming a vicious circle.

I work as a SOC analyst and my primary job function has been triaging alerts, incident response and I spend small amounts of time on purple teaming, threat hunting and developing correlation rules.

I am good at all of the above and I enjoying doing all of it EXCEPT triaging alerts. It takes a lot of my time but doesn't teach me anything new and isn't intellectually challenging. I brought this up to the leadership recently and they offered me a role in the automation team.

The security automation team uses SOAR tools and builds automations to support the analysts.

Do you all think it would be a good idea to switch? My concern is that I love cybersecurity and it is my niche, leaving it doesn't sit with me because I know and I see how important the field is/will be, and I am good at it.
On the other hand, if I need a pleasant change in job functions without taking the automation role, the only option I have currently is to switch companies which I don't really feel like doing because I love my team and the company.

Any thoughts, advice, guidance would be appreciated.
If you read all of this, I already appreciate you even if you didn't respond. Thank you for your time!","Should one switch from incident response role to security automation engineer role

The security automation team uses SOAR tools and builds automations to support the analysts.

Do you all think it would be a good idea to switch? My concern is that I love cybersecurity and it is my niche, leaving it doesn't sit with me because I know and I see how important the field is/will be, and I am good at it.
On the other hand, if I need a pleasant change in job functions without taking the automation role, the only option I have currently is to switch companies which I don't really feel like doing because I love my team and the company.

Any thoughts, advice, guidance would be appreciated.

I'm humbling asking for your guidance and opinion, I been working on IT for quite a few years now in CISCO as support, Load Balancer and the last few year as Technical Account Manager for Web Security (CDN), I got recently the CySA+ and Sec+ but with the experience and knowledge I believe I can get the CISSP.

  
Sadly my current job doesn't seem to have a bright future and I foresee some layoffs and that could include my team, that is why I want to start looking for a different position, and hopefully more oriented to blue team but at the moment I believe speed goes over dreams, so I was thinking that maybe I should get moving on Cloud and get at least one of the 3 big vendors the Solutions Architect certification (I have knowledge on some of the different parts so it's not learning from 0) and later get the CISSP, I'm looking more for a job ""stability"" and hiring than pushing more into Security, as I don't have so much hands on PenTesting or Blue team SOC/Research experience. (I can detect a Web attack and I'm quite familiar with web infra, but I can't detect a AD attack to the DC or a ZAP attack unless IDS/IPS and a SIEM is there for me to search, or preform a RCA or SOC written report for example)

  
So, should I go for the Cloud SA or get the CISSP?, my deadline would be to have any of both by end of year (with a 2-4 hours a day study), I'm looking to apply on other jobs but I just relocated to Canada and I don't have a network of friends for references yet.","Getting the CISSP or moving to Cloud Architect?

Apologies for the long post; TLDR: active duty officer, looking good/efficient. route to become fortune 500 CIO in future

I'm currently an active duty Naval Officer, working as the lead cyber security assessor and department head, which conducts cybersecurity training and assessments on Navy commands. My long term goal is to become a fortune 500 CIO and though I think that's an achievable goal, I know that will take some time. Additionally, I will be separating next year because I believe it would be beneficial for my goal to get civilian experience after 10 years of service.

My short term goal is make efficient use of my next few years to set me up correctly for my long term goal. This includes utilizing my GI bill to obtains a masters (I'm an academic at heart and would love a PhD, or doctorate, but I don't believe this field has any desire for that), and applying to a job that lines up well with future goal. My choices are [SANS.edu](http://SANS.edu) masters or some well established cyber masters program like UC Berkeley, but I open to any path that I haven't considered. I'd like to pursue a masters because it's basically a ""free"" post-graduate degree, and the I believe I can balance the work load.

My concerns (I'll start with the bad since I'm nervous about the future, but hopefully it's not as bad as I think):

- Being a naval officer, I haven't been technical since college. While I understand the concepts, I'm no where near as good at programming, and project management as I was 10 years ago. I'm afraid my lack of expertise will be a deterrent for fortune 500 companies.

- The Navy, and DOD network (DISA), is very different than civilian networks. I pray this isn't too big of a gap between civilian networks and deters employers from wanting to hire me.

- If I were to stay in, theoretically, I'd be looking at around 170k where I live (Southern California), and I'd like to make around that. I wouldn't mind taking a pay cut while I'm learning the nuances of the new industry, but I'm very uneducated about this aspect.

My redeeming features (lol):

- I have a lot of leadership experience, and regularly act as an intermediary between technical and executive teams. (Lots of experience from Cyber Assessments and previous job)

- I have a bachelors in Applied Physics and Computer Science, so I would actually be pretty happy if I had the opportunity to be hands on, even just as an intermediary immersion experience in the new industry.

- While DoDIN networks are different, I'm familiar with the non-vendor specific cyber security concepts from my certs like CISSP, PenTest, and PMP.

- If I decide to work for a company that would like me to have a higher degree, I have the GI bill in my back pocket which (maybe?) is an incentive to higher me.

Regarding my connudrum of which program I should look into, I'm worried if a place like UC Berkeley would even want me. I had 3.5+ gpa from UCSC, 10 years of experience from the Navy, and a bunch of certs, but I haven't taken the GRE/GMAT. 

Thank you for any advice, I really do appreciate any insight anyone could offer, and definitely open to new routes that I haven't listed.","Yet another question about Master's Degree

- Previous military service
- Have a decent entry level cert (SANS) but no other IT experience other than cybersecurity focused self learning.
- Landed Tier 1 SOC analyst role at a very good MSSP (been here 6 months now)
- Have taken to it like a bird to flight and have excelled. I regularly get great feedback from T3 analysts and above. I'm always inquisitive and have learned so much. However, I can start to see the knowledge ceiling approach for on-the-job learning. I doubt a promotion is awaiting despite the good feedback.
- Currently working on some MS certs when I get the chance.

I really love the work itself. I went to my first major industry event and did some awesome networking. The biggest problem with my role is the shift work, the constantly changing shifts are just a killer and on my days off I have so little motivation to do any more learning. By the time I get myself into the zone it is already the opposite shift schedule and I have close to 0 time to study due to commuting to work.

I'm pretty much desperate to move to a new role that is 9-5, as with some consistency in life I feel I can accelerate my learning so much. I would like to land a security engineer role, or perhaps Jr pentester. Even a security analyst that is a more generic role than isolated to the SOC would be worth a move.

How do I beef up my résumé to land those kind of roles? I can very confidently talk about what I do at work, but the theoretical knowledge has started to dwindle as I haven't kept up.

I thought about investing some cash into a homelab setup. Probably an ESXI-based AD environment with a couple of client VMs, maybe a honeypot, PFSense firewall. Anything to get some different type of practise and to start learning new things as I'm gradually being less and less challenged in this way at work.

Any advice would be helpful.","Where to go from SOC Analyst?
I don't tend to use Reddit but I have lurked here for a long time when I was aiming to get into the industry. Here is my brief background:

- Previous military service
- Have a decent entry level cert (SANS) but no other IT experience other than cybersecurity focused self learning.
- Landed Tier 1 SOC analyst role at a very good MSSP (been here 6 months now)
- Have taken to it like a bird to flight and have excelled. I regularly get great feedback from T3 analysts and above. I'm always inquisitive and have learned so much. However, I can start to see the knowledge ceiling approach for on-the-job learning. I doubt a promotion is awaiting despite the good feedback.
- Currently working on some MS certs when I get the chance.

I really love the work itself. I went to my first major industry event and did some awesome networking. The biggest problem with my role is the shift work, the constantly changing shifts are just a killer and on my days off I have so little motivation to do any more learning. By the time I get myself into the zone it is already the opposite shift schedule and I have close to 0 time to study due to commuting to work.

I'm pretty much desperate to move to a new role that is 9-5, as with some consistency in life I feel I can accelerate my learning so much. I would like to land a security engineer role, or perhaps Jr pentester. Even a security analyst that is a more generic role than isolated to the SOC would be worth a move.

How do I beef up my résumé to land those kind of roles? I can very confidently talk about what I do at work, but the theoretical knowledge has started to dwindle as I haven't kept up.

I thought about investing some cash into a homelab setup. Probably an ESXI-based AD environment with a couple of client VMs, maybe a honeypot, PFSense firewall.

Kinda just wanted to share my experience and worries about my first security role, and perhaps if anyone has gone down a similar path.

I got my first security role as a SOC Analyst about 2 months ago. I believe, among other things, luck had a great play in me getting in, for which I am so so grateful, the work is super interesting and I work with the best colleagues I've ever had.

However, I've never felt more lost and incompetent at any other point in my life. I have about 2 years of experience in network support, have taken additional courses/certs in networking, Windows and Linux system administration, and cyber, but coming here it seems as if it would've been the same whether I had that or not.

The amount of knowledge I feel like I'm lacking in the tools, methodologies and way of thinking, and even at times fundamental concepts seems so much that it feels I'll be let go off before I catch up to even half of it.

Each time I build up some confidence, something else pops up that completely shatters it and I feel like I'm even worse than I was at day one.

I have some courses/practical certs planned out, but that does take time too.

Has anyone felt like this is way beyond their abilities but turned out fine? How long did it take you?

Lately I've been considering the next chapter of my career in cyber security, but the problem is I don't think I have had a lot of exposure to the various ""branches"" so to speak of the field to determine what exactly I'd like to be doing. A bit of background:

I graduated 3 years ago with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in International Relations. For the past 2 years, however, I have been working as a SOC Analyst for a company in the medical field. Not a bad job by any means, but not where I'd like to stay. I've always kind of had it in my head to go into cyber security in the law enforcement field, but preferably as a civilian contractor, not a government worker. No hate, just preference. I have the basic certifications (Network+, Security+, etc) and am currently working towards a CySa+ certification, since I've been attempting to do a bit of cross-training with the Cyber Threat Intelligence team at my work. I love the idea of forensics and investigations and all that, but unfortunately my SOC job has me doing more triage than investigations.

My question now becomes... what would those with more experience and wisdom in the field than me suggest I do? Like, how should I proceed, where should I look, all that fun stuff. The basic elements that I simply was never taught lol I'd love to work closely with law enforcement, but if possible I'd prefer to remain civilian. That's not to say I won't take a cool job if I find one though!

  
tl;dr: SOC Analyst of 2 years doesn't know enough about the field to decide the next job position to hunt for, and would love some other POVs or wisdom to figure out the next play or even where best to learn about said plays. Thanks for any and all advice!","Career Advice? Unsure Where To Go Next

For the past 2 years, however, I have been working as a SOC Analyst for a company in the medical field. Not a bad job by any means, but not where I'd like to stay. I've always kind of had it in my head to go into cyber security in the law enforcement field, but preferably as a civilian contractor, not a government worker. No hate, just preference. I have the basic certifications (Network+, Security+, etc) and am currently working towards a CySa+ certification, since I've been attempting to do a bit of cross-training with the Cyber Threat Intelligence team at my work. I love the idea of forensics and investigations and all that, but unfortunately my SOC job has me doing more triage than investigations.

My question now becomes... what would those with more experience and wisdom in the field than me suggest I do? Like, how should I proceed, where should I look, all that fun stuff. The basic elements that I simply was never taught lol I'd love to work closely with law enforcement, but if possible I'd prefer to remain civilian. That's not to say I won't take a cool job if I find one though!

  
tl;dr: SOC Analyst of 2 years doesn't know enough about the field to decide the next job position to hunt for, and would love some other POVs or wisdom to figure out the next play or even where best to learn about said plays. Thanks for any and all advice!",career advice unsure where to go next hello reddit first post ever so sorry if i mess up etiquette or something. lately i ve been considering the next chapter of my career in cyber security but the problem is i don t think i have had a lot of exposure to the various branches so to speak of the field to determine what exactly i d like to be doing. a bit of background: i graduated   years ago with a degree in computer science and a minor in international relations. for the past   years however i have been working as a soc analyst for a company in the medical field. not a bad job by any means but not where i d like to stay. i ve always kind of had it in my head to go into cyber security in the law enforcement field but preferably as a civilian contractor not a government worker. no hate just preference. i have the basic certifications and am currently working towards a cysa certification since i ve been attempting to do a bit of cross training with the cyber threat intelligence team at my work. i love the idea of forensics and investigations and all that but unfortunately my soc job has me doing more triage than investigations. my question now becomes... what would those with more experience and wisdom in the field than me suggest i do like how should i proceed where should i look all that fun stuff. the basic elements that i simply was never taught lol i d love to work closely with law enforcement but if possible i d prefer to remain civilian. that s not to say i won t take a cool job if i find one though tl dr: soc analyst of   years doesn t know enough about the field to decide the next job position to hunt for and would love some other povs or wisdom to figure out the next play or even where best to learn about said plays. thanks for any and all advice,1,0,1840,1783,2024,6,Wednesday,19,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1dp70uk/career_advice_unsure_where_to_go_next/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1dp70uk/career_advice_unsure_where_to_go_next/,1,0.4643496487255292,0.5356503512744708,SVM (Linear)

Hello guys

I am interested in starting my career in Cybersecurity. I did my postgraduate degree in Information Security 

I had no prior experience in IT but in software development. I once read online that I would have to get my fundamentals in IT strong before I start a career in cyber. I secured a job in IT help desk. (Which I am still pursuing) I started out on a part-time contract initially working on basic administrative duties but the people in my current workplace really liked my work and ability to pick on new technologies quickly.

I got moved to a systems administrator role. From there, Luckily there was a requirement for us to obtain cyber essentials. I have been supporting this process throughout this year attending various tech shows and conferences trying to network and reach out with product and service providers to help us find the right solution.

I learnt a lot in this process. Starting with Endpoint detection response, Vulnerability Management, firewall management, id say sophos edr, qualys vm, m365 defender and things like, GDPR. I have also conducted workshops for students on online safety awareness 
 
I supported my manager in providing IT security training to all teaching staff and I helped him with drafting E-Safety policies.
it has been a year now

It has been more than six months now (UK market - London)

I have been applying to various jobs on almost every platform and I don’t seem to get even one call back. It has really been hard as companies don’t provide active feedback for me to understand why I am not being called even for an interview. The most common reply would be 

“Due to high volume of applicants we are unable to move your application further”

I can’t understand why and I would really appreciate some advice. What am I lacking here? What would you suggest me to do? What should my next step be?

I've been working on a SaaS platform that helps companies make better hires using CTF style challenges. Job applicants complete tailored hiring assessments, and the platform ranks them on a leaderboard based on their performance. It breaks down their skills, strengths, and weaknesses.

I won't post the link here since I know there are rules about advertising, but I would really appreciate any advice or input on the concept. I'm a former SOC Manager, and I built this platform to solve a problem I faced myself. I  quit my full-time job to go all in on this project.

I'd love your insights on a few things:

1. **Value of Data-Driven Hiring**: How important is it to make hiring decisions based on data?
2. **Ranking Applicants by Technical Ability**: How valuable is it to be able to rank a large number of applicants by their skills? Automatically? In a leaderboard?

I'm also trying to pinpoint the biggest pain points this platform could solve, like:

* Helping HR shortlist candidates for interviews.
* Saving hours of manual resume screening.
* Reducing the risk of a bad hire.
* Lowering cyber risk by hiring better talent.

Do any of these resonate with you? Are these issues you face? Would a solution like this be useful or valuable to you? How much do you think it would be worth?

Also, I'm looking for people to test the platform for free in exchange for feedback. If you're interested, please let me know.

I've tried some cold outreach while building the MVP, but I didn't get any positive responses. I'm feeling pretty disheartened and wondering if the idea just doesn't solve a real problem or if I'm just really bad at sales and marketing.

Since I haven't received any replies, no one has actually tested the solution yet. Any advice or feedback to give me hope that I haven't wasted my time would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks a lot!","My startup is finally ready to launch and I'm looking for some advice

From what I've seen during my experience, many companies deploy their infrastructure and data into the cloud. However, since our legislation (my auditing standard) doesn't cover the cloud, companies usually don't focus too much on this space from a cybersecurity perspective. I also passed SANS GCIH this year, where some of the modules focused on cloud security, which revealed to me even more the complexity of securing the cloud. That's when I thought I might specialize in this area because it's becoming more and more important, and most teams don't have the capacity to invest their time in this.

I have been in GRC for over 7 years and I have never met anyone, including myself, that actually went into GRC due to passion. Much of the daily tasks and activities are very manual, with a crap ton of paperwork, manual testing, and policy development. And GRC is one of the least sexy areas of cybersecurity. 

I got into GRC because of my extensive background in both financial and IT risk management. But my background in coding, testing and validation, and RPA also got me into SOC, IA, threat hunting, and pen testing.  And I can absolutely say that GRC is absolutely a snooze fest. Don’t get me wrong, the work is absolutely a necessity, but I feel like those who get into cyber for the wrong reasons always end up leading to bad delivery, services, and product. And lots of people who transitioned into GRC did so to have “cybersecurity” under their belt. I’m not trying to gate keep the profession by any means.

But my concern is my latest encounters with about in GRC. Those without actual experience in IT or software development prior to GRC, is that people’s perspective on risk management becomes very one dimensional. I cannot count how many times I have to explain that security process, policy, and compliance risk shouldn’t not lead to neglecting operational risk. No, Allen, another key control or policy to maintain segregation of duties is not going to help when you have only two fullstack application developers working in your dev, testing, and prod enviornment. 

My point: I don’t know why people are more interested about GRC lately when the work is the least Cyber-like work and is super manual. People with no real interest in the world of cyber and business leads to terrible cyber policies and recommendations. I hope people going into this have a semblence of passion that will get them to be more well-rounded work products and services than what I’ve seen lately.

My current company is pretty decent overall. Great people and culture, okay salary, ""unlimited"" PTO (that's not even real, I don't know how that term even flies anymore), and I do get to work remote.

As a former SDE, and now appsec engineer, I'm well aware of the attitude devs have towards anyone messing with their IDE (don't touch it). However, the threat landscape relies on that mentality as a prime vector for exploitation.

I've considered pushing for IT to fully manage IDEs (the binaries themselves, at least keep the IDEs up to date) but after further thought I'm thinking we might be able to leverage some of our other secops tooling and some custom scripting to manage extensions as well.

My experience: 

Former IT Compliance Analyst.  I prefer Information Security Analyst because recruiters sometimes don't know what a compliance analyst does.  I did a mix of cybersecurity, auditing, and some information security.  I mostly made sure the System Admins were compliant.  My jobs before those, I was the guy making sure things were compliant. On my resume though, I can only claim that I had 1 year of Information Security experience.  The rest were mostly Technical Support Analyst roles (imaging, setting up users for work). I have the ticketing experience with ServiceNow. I have Excel experience up to I would say 2-3 years. I want to say more, but in some jobs they were not challenging. Only recently, the jobs have been challenging and I have no foundation. 

I come from a small town to big city experience.  Small town IT we did things that big city IT folk wouldn't do.  As a result, I have holes in my experience.  My associates was years ago, but it is relative to what I am working on A+, Net+, and Sec+. I passed my Security+ thinking that would help me get a job since I had experience to match it. Still nothing. 

At this point, it is not my resume and how it looks. It's my experience and not knowing anybody in the field since I left the University. The people that are offering jobs are in states I would rather not be in due to my bad experience being there (couple years in a state and I was discriminated and experienced racism). Where I am currently living I do experience racism, but it's my home state.  Only issue, no one is hiring for my low level experience. 

I did manage to network with a cybersecurity engineer which was great. I'm going to create labs and record and upload to social media. Hope that helps, but I'm still thinking IT overall might not be for me since I might have the ADHD that hurts my chances of keeping a job.  

If nothing comes of this. I understand. I'm not in the least bit deserving of help. I have done remote with my previous job. I came in eventually due to our ISP having lousy downtime for weeks sometimes. New place I am in seems to be going smoothly. I am just without a job right now after only doing a 2 month contract.  Puzzled as hell why it happened since I did not get feedback from the client. Only was told, ""Your assignment is completed."" Like, what the fuck? I moved closer to you so I could be more attentive for the job and I finished your 1 week training worth ($1,899 - $2,500) with a 89%.  I signed a non-compete to top it off, so I probably can't work in a datacenter for awhile. Not unless that FTC ban actually stands.  So, right now, I am trying to get back into compliance work. Hopefully, entry level Information Security work.  I know the CIA triad, I know how to follow physical security according to SOC 2 and ISO 27001 guidelines.  I know how to find the HIPAA and 800-53 NIST files in order to implement those security recommendations to pass an audit.  I only have 1 year of doing it.  IT market is probably in a recession.  Been looking for scraps at this point.  I do know companies need help though. So fuck it. I will volunteer to get experience unpaid if needed.

I'm at a bit of a crossroads in my cybersecurity career and hoping to get some advice from the community.

 Here's the deal:

Been in cybersec for 4 years, bouncing around SOC, Threat Intel, and basic pentesting.  
i have wokred for several good companies 

1 : Never wanted to be in management, so I've focused on technical roles.

2: My passion lies in red teaming and application security (offensive side!), but my coding experience is limited (though I've done some personal projects).

My Big mistake: never got any major certs – they were expensive, and I dreaded failing the exams.

Recently moved to Germany for masters – awesome! But the job hunt is tough without German fluency.

Now, I'm stuck. How do I transition into the offensive security side, especially considering the language barrier in Germany?

Here is what i am currently doing in my off time from university 

1 : going through he portswigger labs

2: learning about Docker , Kubernetes , azure  security and pentesting 

Anyone with similar experiences or advice for this situation?

Here's what I'm particularly interested in:

Tips for breaking into red teaming/application security without extensive coding.

Cost-effective certification paths for offensive security (or are certs even essential?).

Strategies for landing a cybersec job in Germany without German fluency (yet!).



Thanks in advance for any insights!","Stuck in Cyber Purgatory: Transitioning to Offensive Security

If these degrees are fully funded, you have the opportunity to explore completely new topics through coursework while conducting independent research. You get time to study for certs, do projects, network with others in the cybersec world, and really grow your knowledge base for cybersecurity everyday. I am currently doing research that I would probably never be able to do if I was not in academia.

NEVER EVER do a phd that isn't fully funded. You may be interested in a master's degree that isn't funded; just do your due diligence and be very clear about what you want to get out of it. Also be clear that without adequate experience (work + internship + projects + certs) you will struggle to get a job. Even with those, you  may struggle in this current job market. With that said:

Master's Degrees:

Any degree is a waste of time if you're not making the most of it. If that's the case, don't blame the system!! IMO people who feel their MS or PHDs were a waste of their time, ironically, are bad researchers; they simply did not do the research to determine how to make the most of these degrees (which are meant to be research degrees at their cores). Contrastingly, if a master's simply isn't something you are interested in, that's totally fine! But that doesn't mean it's a useless pursuit for everyone who is interested in cybersecurity.

Not to mention over the past 10 or so years masters degrees have started to look more and more robust. There are certainly degrees out there that look like absolute BS (not in the bachelor's of science sense), but for every one of those, there are several masters programs that are well-developed and would most certainly benefit someone who *wants* to benefit from them. Be smart and differentiate between a stellar program and a sham.

PHDs:

My advice to anyone interested in getting a PHD in computer security is to read abstracts of dissertations that computer science/cybersec/network security PHD holders have published in the past, and to research current universities/labs which are conducting research that you are interested in - and then make your call. Again, a key part of an MS or a PHD is actually doing research, which starts with researching whether there are phd programs out there that align with your overarching interests. Just because a comment on reddit calls your degree a useless waste of time doesn't mean you should not go for it lol

PS the best research in cybersec comes in from CS, ECE, and  Information science phds. ""cybersecurity phds"" themselves will mostly be computer science or ECE phd students who focus on security applications (cryptography, algorithms, hardware security).","In defense of degrees

IMO people who feel their MS or PHDs were a waste of their time, ironically, are bad researchers; they simply did not do the research to determine how to make the most of these degrees (which are meant to be research degrees at their cores). Contrastingly, if a master's simply isn't something you are interested in, that's totally fine! But that doesn't mean it's a useless pursuit for everyone who is interested in cybersecurity.

Not to mention over the past 10 or so years masters degrees have started to look more and more robust. There are certainly degrees out there that look like absolute BS (not in the bachelor's of science sense), but for every one of those, there are several masters programs that are well-developed and would most certainly benefit someone who *wants* to benefit from them. Be smart and differentiate between a stellar program and a sham.

PHDs:

My advice to anyone interested in getting a PHD in computer security is to read abstracts of dissertations that computer science/cybersec/network security PHD holders have published in the past, and to research current universities/labs which are conducting research that you are interested in - and then make your call. Again, a key part of an MS or a PHD is actually doing research, which starts with researching whether there are phd programs out there that align with your overarching interests. Just because a comment on reddit calls your degree a useless waste of time doesn't mean you should not go for it lol

PS the best research in cybersec comes in from CS, ECE, and  Information science phds. ""cybersecurity phds"" themselves will mostly be computer science or ECE phd students who focus on security applications (cryptography, algorithms, hardware security).",in defense of degrees it s pretty frustrating to see people in this sub often say a ms or a phd in cybersec are a waste of time. if these degrees are fully funded you have the opportunity to explore completely new topics through coursework while conducting independent research. you get time to study for certs do projects network with others in the cybersec world and really grow your knowledge base for cybersecurity everyday. i am currently doing research that i would probably never be able to do if i was not in academia. never ever do a phd that isn t fully funded. you may be interested in a master s degree that isn t funded just do your due diligence and be very clear about what you want to get out of it. also be clear that without adequate experience you will struggle to get a job. even with those you may struggle in this current job market. with that said: master s degrees: any degree is a waste of time if you re not making the most of it. if that s the case don t blame the system imo people who feel their ms or phds were a waste of their time ironically are bad researchers they simply did not do the research to determine how to make the most of these degrees . contrastingly if a master s simply isn t something you are interested in that s totally fine but that doesn t mean it s a useless pursuit for everyone who is interested in cybersecurity. not to mention over the past    or so years masters degrees have started to look more and more robust. there are certainly degrees out there that look like absolute bs but for every one of those there are several masters programs that are well developed and would most certainly benefit someone who wants to benefit from them. be smart and differentiate between a stellar program and a sham. phds: my advice to anyone interested in getting a phd in computer security is to read abstracts of dissertations that computer science cybersec network security phd holders have published in the past and to research current universities labs which are conducting research that you are interested in   and then make your call. again a key part of an ms or a phd is actually doing research which starts with researching whether there are phd programs out there that align with your overarching interests. just because a comment on reddit calls your degree a useless waste of time doesn t mean you should not go for it lol ps the best research in cybersec comes in from cs ece and information science phds. cybersecurity phds themselves will mostly be computer science or ece phd students who focus on security applications .,1,0,2800,2584,2024,7,Tuesday,16,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1e4tr6c/in_defense_of_degrees/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1e4tr6c/in_defense_of_degrees/,1,0.3332557807308603,0.6667442192691397,SVM (Linear)

Thanks in advance!",where to take career hi everyone i m currently in cybersecurity. have been working in it for slightly more than   years while doing my masters degree from a top    cybersecurity school on the side. i ve learned about this industry in multiple ways and have become slightly disillusioned. it seems that a lot of it is just boring    and boring it especially. maybe it is just a function of being in my particular employer but i m starting to doubt that i can do this for the next    years. to be blunt i m miserable. investigate phishing email this crunch a security alert this consult on some tool that do some adjustment of configurations monitor your network adjust the firewalls push some paperwork pass an audit. i feel that my brain is rotting. i also would like to note that i can type code like a software engineer since i ve been doing it since age   . but computer science people who just type if else and are programmers are over saturating that field as well. besides just generic software development isn t as interesting nor as specialized    and ai will teat it away. then there is the automation issue. we are seeing an increased reliance on automation of alerting tools and capabilities in this space    and organizations have been moving more and more functionality to the cloud. . as things get more and more moved towards the cloud then with the new introduction of automated software tools and now ai it seems that more and more of the functionality will be taken away from end cybersecurity analysts engineers. then added into that in the private sector there is massive outsourcing of it and security functionality. i see for example socs being near shored in places like costa rica and security engineering colocated for companies in india. i also am currently in the public sector    and it doesn t appeal to me . so i m trying to determine the next career steps    and even flirted with the thought of quitting the security industry entirely for greener pastures. wanted to ask you all if you have any ideas for potential next steps both cybersecurity and non cybersecurity related. i hope that whatever step i do next is mentally engaging    i feel that my brain is rotting. thanks in advance,1,4,2408,2218,2024,7,Thursday,23,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1e6puig/where_to_take_career/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1e6puig/where_to_take_career/,1,0.34102846886894944,0.6589715311310506,SVM (Linear)

I was offered a renewal in the US for a job position in Cyber GRC for good money (x3 as much I would made in Spain). I would need to perform internal audit for SOX, FedRAMP and other control frameworks, coordinate with different teams, manage tasks, and overall **bureaucracy.** The only good thing is the WLB.

I have 2 YOE at Cyber GRC (they call it that). I'm a bit burnt out from doing menial tasks like sending lots of emails, excels and words, analyzing documents texts like I'm a lawyer... Not what I thought I was going to do when I was studying Computer Science.

What worries me now is if I should accept this job, I was about to change my job to Software Engineering or maybe IT Security or AppSec but accepting this job offer would triple my salary compared to what I would be earning for Software Engineering or Computer Technical Security in Spain.

I am looking to gather information on the SOC structure you are running. If I could get some general input and guidelines from folks who run SOC operations or team members contributing that would be great.

I myself am not part of the core SOC team in my company but have somewhat overlay with some products and responibilites. So a shared responsibility model.

How big is your team and how many identities/endpoints do you cover? Are you a ""one man does it all"" type of shop where everyone is doing everything or have you separated your responsiblities? If so, how? How many sub-divisions inside SOC do you have and how does that look like?

Do you have separate triage specialsits, threat hunters/analysts? Soc Manager overseeing operations? Does your team have a dedicated Security Engineer/Architect or InfraSec team running patches or configuring the operation part of the SOC products you use, if not, who is responsible for that? ItOps? What about compliance team? Do you develop software/solutions at your place and is there a dedicated AppSec team/member overseeing application security?

There are many useful resources out there that describe the basic security architecture, correct, but I would really look forward to get input from folks out on the field who have experience and would like to share their input on this topic.

Here is an AI summary of the book:

Cal Newport's ""Slow Productivity"" offers a new philosophy for achieving meaningful work without burnout, based on three key principles:

1. Do fewer things: Newport advocates for reducing commitments and obligations to focus on what truly matters. This approach allows for better results by enabling workers to concentrate on high-value tasks rather than simply being busy.
2. Work at a natural pace: Instead of constant urgency, Newport suggests giving important work the time it needs. This principle recognizes that humans are not wired for unceasing intensity, and that a more varied, natural pace leads to sustainable productivity in the long term. Strategies include making longer-term plans, doubling project timeline estimates, and introducing ""seasonality"" into work schedules.
3. Obsess over quality: Newport emphasizes the importance of producing high-quality work, even if it means missing short-term opportunities. This focus on quality both demands and enables a slower pace, leading to more meaningful career results over time.

The book argues that the modern approach to knowledge work, which often emphasizes constant activity and urgency, is unsustainable and ineffective. Instead, Newport proposes a more intentional and deliberate approach to work that aligns better with human nature and leads to more fulfilling and productive outcomes.""Slow Productivity"" challenges the culture of overwork and constant hustle, offering an alternative that aims to make work a source of meaning rather than overwhelm while still maintaining valuable output. By implementing these principles, Newport suggests that individuals can achieve better results, experience greater satisfaction in their work, and avoid burnout.","Have you read Slow Productivity by Cal Newport?

I am trying to continue my professional development through online courses in what little free time I have, but my ultimate question is: is it supposed to be this way? I know that entry level positions are often stuck with the menial work that senior engineers don’t want to do, but is it normal to barely learn anything at all?

I have been working as a SOC analyst at a small company for about 4 years now, really small team , work is to solve security alerts of users within the company. I have access to a lot of tools- CASB, EDR , SIEM of course to analyze logs but most of it is busy work resolving false positives , sometimes look at phishing emails etc. Also worked a bit with vulnerability management getting teams to patch their stuff , also did some work on security reviews for any new software being bought. 

Before that worked for a MSSP as a SOC analyst , 24x7 shifts , very intense with work performance being evaluated by number of tickets we solved per hour (as an example). Most of the work was log analysis, some tuning alerts as well.

I also have an MS degree in Cybersecurity .. feel like I haven't done much with my career .. I feel very bored / frustrated with my work on a daily basis.. this wasn't exactly what I aimed for/ hoped to do for work.. solve the same kind of alerts with not much changing in years.

My dream is to work as a security engineer for a Big Tech company , but even within that I am not sure what to think of/ go for.. I have no experience in Application security except projects in Uni , I did a security certification for pen testing 5 years ago. 

Product security roles look interesting too but again I don't have professional experience in it so far.

I have some scripting skills, I have experience with Python and JavaScript, I feel like if I practice a bit I might be able to do Leetcode easy level problems, but been out of touch for a while. 

  
I don't know where exactly to go from here but I don't wish to work on alerts in a SOC. Any guidance you have on where I can go from here or what I should be doing and where to study from would be appreciated. Not been promoted and I don't see any career growth in my current role.

I work to live, I definitely don’t live to work. I’m an artist that had to give it up on account of having no money at all. I can see how I’ve been sort of clocking in doing work and clocking out but I don’t really know how to not do that/what I should be doing.

I’m about to hit one year as a cybersec professional, I have my Sec+ but the only other certs I have are ISC CC , AZ900, and I’m taking the AZ 104 soon (hopefully before my one year mark).Ny manager has helped me plan my next certifications but I know I need to do more than just test.

I was told to join groups but which groups ? And what should I be doing in them ? I’m an introvert but I’m not shy (usually), so it’s harder for me to be social and know if I’m doing it right.

Also , does the imposter syndrome go away. Anytime I can’t answer a technical question I feel like I conned my way into this job. Is that normal?","How to avoid complacency?

Got a job offer for a local manufacturing sports-related company and am debating on if it's worth switching from my mostly remote GRC position. I say mostly remote because it is *technically* remote but I find myself travelling for 3-4 days at a time no less than once per month, sometimes upwards of 3 times per month. 

Current role:

* Remote GRC / consultant related role with decent job security but not guaranteed long term.
* Good freedom, benefits, flexible ""unlimited"" PTO (as long I request 2+ months in advance).
* Good co-workers that leave me alone. However, management is completely disconnected. 
* Have to travel A LOT, which is exhausting me and causing strain on personal relationships.
* Capped out in current role and zero opportunities for a raise or lateral movement. Stagnant.
* Pay isn't what it should be. Have CISSP and years of experience but capped out at $90k.
* Schedule requires me to work 2ish hours earlier than peers in my time-zone.
* Generally unfulfilling work that I am not learning in anymore and find most days frustrating or annoying.
* Can cruise and ""deal with"" most of the issues I have but am in late 20s and want to pursue more excitement.



New potential role:

* On-site position 10 minutes from house. Can work from home on Friday's and possibly more days in future after on-site work is complete (cable running, security camera & badge reader project, etc.).
* Opportunity to build InfoSec program from the ground up. Leadership & management heavily supported. 
* Company does not have formal InfoSec but wants ownership in this regard. This will imply that I am ""owning"" all of InfoSec for a company with less than 120 users and does not have InfoSec formalized.
* Opportunity to define role for myself and grow as the company sees fit. Initially suggested to move into a development role after some internal IT projects were addressed, but development is not my niche, so I was able to advertise my InfoSec skills to leadership and they bit the hook.
* More hands on / technical role (something I miss from earlier days in IT).
* Likely a heavier burden of daily work & may introduce longer days.
* $20-30k pay increase (bump up to $110-$120k). Mostly same benefits minus flexible PTO.
* Have absolutely zero passion for the specific industry that the company is in, but that could change.
* Potential to meet new friends in a new-to-me area that I have been struggling to socialize in.
* Potential to learn a vast array of hard skills and technical concepts with opportunities in position.

  
Certainly there is more that I'm overlooking, but what would you do? Keep the ""comfortable"", yet boring and stagnant, remote job and accept the lower pay while having to travel several times a month for the foreseeable future?

I need some advice from you all. My career path has been a bit of a rollercoaster, and I'm hoping to get some perspective from folks who might have been in similar shoes. Here's my story:

**From Civil Engineer to Tech Startup:** I’ve been a civil engineer in the Philippines for about a decade. It’s a solid job, but in 2022, I took on a part-time gig at a tech startup to earn some extra cash. This startup was into growth-hacking consultancy (basically, online B2B marketing). The company was tiny—just two founders and me, their first full-time employee.

By the end of 2022, they asked me to go full-time as their operations manager. The deal was: Founder 1 would finance our operations, Founder 2 would handle marketing, and I would design and run the company's systems. The exciting part? Once we were stable, we’d shift to Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and cybersecurity.

**Learning about OSINT and Cybersecurity:** I dived into OSINT research and was instantly hooked. It felt like I’d found my true calling. After weeks of thinking it over, I decided to leave my engineering job and go all-in with the startup just because of the potential alone. I figured I’d tough out the B2B marketing phase and eventually get to the good stuff—cybersecurity.

**Reality Check:** Fast forward two years, and while I learned a ton (thanks Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, and BlackHatWorld!), things weren’t panning out as I’d hoped. The founders seemed content just breaking even, and with me being the only full-timer, the shift to OSINT and cybersecurity seemed like a pipe dream.

**Back to Square One:** Two months ago, I decided to call it quits. I needed to pay the bills (and feed my adorable Frenchie), so I went back to civil engineering. But now, it just doesn’t feel right anymore. My heart is set on cybersecurity, and I can’t shake the feeling that if I don’t pursue it, I’ll always wonder “what if.”

**So, Here I Am:** I’m turning 32 this year, and I’m kinda freaking out. Is it too late to start a career in cybersecurity? I’ve got this burning passion, but I’m scared of losing it if I don’t act soon. Life’s taught me that finding true happiness gets tougher as you get older, and I don’t want to miss out on this chance.

So, what do you think? Is a career switch to cybersecurity doable at my age? Any tips on how to make it happen? I’d love to hear your thoughts, experiences, or any resources you can share.

Thanks for reading my story and for any advice you can offer.

Can't a good Threat Hunter have the same consideration as a SecEng?",get far away from soc so i was talking with a ciso recently and he said he makes the following distinction:   read team: if you can do it go for it because it is very rewarding and that s where you can find most pros .   blue team: you will learn a lot and has a wide variety of roles and most job offers are for blue team anyway.   soc: only do it if it is extremely necessary. avoid it all you can and if you have to do it get away as soon as possible. now my question is how true is this is a soc where cybersecurity careers go to die it s obvious that a soc analyst tier   should try to to move up quickly but aren t incident response and threat hunting good places to be is the only proper way up to become a security engineer can t a good threat hunter have the same consideration as a seceng,206,117,877,798,2024,8,Sunday,8,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1epgahe/get_far_away_from_soc/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1epgahe/get_far_away_from_soc/,1,0.7778559201115962,0.7778559201115962,SVM (Linear)

I know this has come up before and been posted a few times but I would like fresh answers and ideas based on my current position.

I started as an L1 SOC analyst at a MSSP for about 2 years before being burnt out from shifts, undelivered promises and hitting the skill-level causing me to become bored.   
I then moved on to another company providing MSSP and CySec consulting as just a ""SOC Analyst"" where there are no levels/tiers. I was the first SOC analyst to be hired. Besides the day-to-day monitoring/threat hunting/RCA activities of an analyst, I also deploy, integrate and manage the SIEM/XDR tools to all our clients and new clients that come on. Additionally, I also do the IR and consulting monthly with clients at the C-level.  
Even some Vulnerability management and testing.

I have become the go to person when it comes to all thing SOC mentioned above.  
  
I am tired of being on-call all the time, having to work shifts and just generally being on the SOC.

Besides being heavily underpaid, I am not happy, not challenged and getting bored again.  
I feel like I'm going no where. Hitting the ceiling again etc.

Any advice on where to move towards in my career as well as how to start getting there would be highly appreciated :}","Moving on and up from SOC? Not sure on first steps

How does this project sound to you, whether from the perspective of a potential user of the product or a hiring manager reviewing it on a resume?",what s your take on the market for an open source grc tool i m a computer science student considering ideas for my senior project. i have a year to develop software with a friend which we ll submit as part of our graduation requirement. in the past i worked with the servicenow grc module and i found it incredibly frustrating. it seemed like most of the teams at my previous workplace disliked the tool as well which got me thinking: maybe a no frills open source grc tool could be beneficial for small to medium sized businesses that don t have the budget for enterprise level solutions like servicenow or sap. i m aware there are already a few free alternatives out there like eramba and ciso assistant with eramba being the most comprehensive and promising in my opinion. we re not aiming to reach that level of sophistication but i think this could be an interesting project that would allow us to become very familiar with grc overall. plus it seems like a fairly challenging and interesting software development project. how does this project sound to you whether from the perspective of a potential user of the product or a hiring manager reviewing it on a resume,2,0,1248,1171,2024,8,Sunday,21,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1evkuo0/whats_your_take_on_the_market_for_an_opensource/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1evkuo0/whats_your_take_on_the_market_for_an_opensource/,1,0.6192485054293237,0.6192485054293237,SVM (Linear)

Hey r/Cybersecurity! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I wanted to share my experience and some advice for those embarking on the journey of self-studying cybersecurity.

## The Challenge

Let's be real: starting your cybersecurity journey can feel like trying to drink from a firehose. The field is vast, constantly evolving, and can be overwhelming at first. You might find yourself lost in a sea of acronyms, struggling to understand complex concepts, or feeling like you're always three steps behind.

But here's the thing: **every single professional in this field started exactly where you are now.**

## The Mindset

1. **Embrace the struggle**: Each challenge you face is an opportunity to learn and grow. The frustration you feel when tackling a difficult concept? That's your brain expanding.

2. **Consistency over intensity**: It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than to burn out with 8-hour cram sessions.

3. **Build a foundation**: Start with the basics. Networking, operating systems, and programming fundamentals are your building blocks.

## The Path

1. **Start with the CompTIA trifecta**: A+, Network+, and Security+. These certs will give you a solid foundation.

2. **Hands-on practice**: Set up a home lab. Break things. Fix them. Repeat.

3. **Dive into resources**: 
   - Platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox
   - Books: ""The Web Application Hacker's Handbook"" and ""The Hacker Playbook"" series
   - YouTube channels: NetworkChuck, John Hammond, David Bombal

4. **Join the community**: Engage in forums like this one, join Discord servers, attend local meetups or virtual conferences.

5. **Specialize**: Once you have a grasp of the basics, dive deeper into areas that interest you (e.g., network security, malware analysis, pen testing).

## The Reality Check

You will feel lost. You will question if you're cut out for this. You will have moments where nothing seems to make sense.

But then, something magical happens. You'll solve a CTF challenge that seemed impossible a month ago. You'll explain a complex concept to someone else and realize how far you've come. You'll look back and be amazed at your progress.

Remember: **Every lesson learned is knowledge gained**. Your journey might be rough, but it's also incredibly rewarding.

To those just starting: Welcome to one of the most exciting, challenging, and important fields out there. You've got this!

Veterans of the field: What advice would you add for our newcomers?

1ew5sne,cybersecurity,Fourply99,2024-08-19 16:11:23,1724083883,Is a Bachelor’s Degree worth pursuing given my background? ,"Hey everyone! I'm arriving at a bit of a crossroads in my career decisions. Put shortly - I want to specialize while reducing the customer-facing side of my job role. To cut to the chase - I'm looking for some guidance from some of you industry veterans on whether or not it's worth it to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity with my background or if it makes more sense to try diving right into some applications. 

Work experience-wise I have a little over 5 years of combined time in the IT industry: 

* I've been working for VMware (now Broadcom. Yes, it's rough here.) as a Technical Support Engineer for \~2 years and specialize in ESXi, VM, Certificate, Network, and vCenter management SME categories. 
* Before that I worked at an MSP for \~2.5 years and learned more than I could have ever hoped to in such a short period of time. My skill-set developed with desktop support, active directory, network stack (multiple vendors), MDM, Azure, Microsoft 365, Exchange Online, Google Workspace, VOIP system, account, endpoint, and network security policy, and other types of administration experience. In addition to this I also was put into the role of a Project Manager for some clients and towards the end of my time with this small MSP became the primary client-facing ""on-site"" technician for just about every major client we had. 
* My break into the IT industry was a temp/internship PoS support desk role at a retail corporation that was cut short at 6 months because I was laid off when March 2020 happened. While this role didn't exactly encompass much on the technical side, it helped me get to my position at the MSP above. I was still a full-time student when I took this job.

My formal education and certifications aren't anything to write home about in the slightest, but I do have an Associate's Degree in Computer Networking and Cyber Security from a Community College (the program was basically just a CCNA bootcamp. The 'security' side of it was practically non-existent). I also have/had a CompTia A+ (expired May of 2024) that I used strictly as leverage to get a raise at my MSP job as I was greener than grass at the time I was hired there and had not even completed schooling yet. It took me <1 mo to get both A+ tests prepped, booked, and passed. 

  
With all this in mind, here is the long form of the question - I have been working through [tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com) to see if the pentesting route is something I find interest in as I always had a desire to learn Linux, but never had the drive to do it. Learning how to hack into things gives me something 'cool' to do with Linux and has started me down the path to learning more than I did with creating BASH scripts for package installations on Apple MDM platforms. I find this stuff very interesting/fun and have throughout the years found it fun educating not only end-users, but also management/C-Level personnel how quick and easy it is to make a few changes to ensure simple attack vectors can be mitigated (and subsequently save money/data from the potential fallout). Especially when talking to the management teams at my MSP clients you would see these people light up with joy when you do something as easy as MFA on emails because they understand it significantly reduces the chance of an account breach. Security has always been fascinating to me. Seeing how 9/10 times when a breach occurs it's due to negligence leads me to want to pursue this as a career path from the broader background I have.

Is it even worth it to pursue a Bachelor's Degree given that I already have an Associates in Cybersecurity and 5+ years experience in the field? I know at the very least getting the Net+ and Sec+ for my resume are good first steps, but the monetary setback of a degree is daunting. Should I just jump into some job applications now, or am I too unqualified for some roles just yet? Specifically I am looking to first dip my toes in with a Security Analyst role. 

To avoid this dragging on further I'll end it here, but any input is greatly appreciated :)

That being said, anyone looking for a new position right now will tell you it's tough out there; tougher than it has been since 2008-2010.

Let's hear some of your stories. Here is mine:

I'm a junior-level associate with 4 years of experience and a matured educational background. I'm currently working in the field as an InfoSec Risk Analyst II. My compensatory analysis shows that I'm being underpaid by nearly 30% according to position/regional midpoint and have recently begun searching for another job after discovering this.

After submitting 40+ applications using tailored resumes including keywords from the job descriptions, l've only received 2 callbacks from recruiters, both of which concerning positions at new consultancy firms which have little to no job security. My resume is 'top tier' according to multiple resume websites and Al tools. I also alter it to contain specific keywords from each job description before submitting. I am not applying to positions that are 'out of my league' by any means.

From 2021 - 2023 I was able to steadily 'climb the ladder' relatively easy. Three separate times, I was able to secure new, higher-paying positions within one month of beginning my application submission process. I would receive an average of 5 interviews and 3 written job offers within this one month timeframe.

After beginning my new job search a month ago, l've only received 2 call backs and one interview request, both from new/unvetted consultancy firms that offer little/no job security.

1ex8yw0,cybersecurity,Dry-Actuary1591,2024-08-20 22:25:44,1724192744,Stuck on career advancement ,"Hello everyone,

I'm currently at a crossroads with my job, and I could use some advice. I recently graduated with a bachelor’s in cybersecurity and had two job offers when I finished school. One was for an IT auditing position in SOC, and the other was for a security analyst role. I have about 2 years of helpdesk experience and 1 year of cybersecurity analyst experience under my belt. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to earn any certifications during my university days due to a lack of funding.

I ended up choosing the IT auditing job, and I've been at it for about 6 months now. To be honest, I find the work quite mundane and boring. The upside is that I usually finish my tasks early, which gives me a lot of free time during the day. The job also offers fast promotions due to the heavy workload, and there's potential to transition into the Pen Testing branch if I obtain an OSCP certification—assuming a spot opens up.

I'm torn between sticking it out for another year or year and a half in hopes of moving into Pen Testing or exploring more technical roles right away. On one hand, the job pays the bills, and it’s remote, which is great and I’ve made some great friends so far and they raise pretty fast, for example once I hit a year of being here I’m moved up 10-15k on my salary. On the other hand I’m really just struggling to want to doing this work, it’s not really interesting to me or makes me want to wake up and do this, the workload is also high,the expectations of making profit are always high and if we have a low income year we get laid off, management is good but really doesn’t help with the workload and we are basically work mules for them.

I really enjoy technical projects like tackling challenging problems like coding projects, working on CTFs, and doing raspberry pi projects. I'm also intrigued by careers in data science, cloud computing, and blockchain development. I have experience with C, Java, HTML, and Linux/Kali Linux, which I’d love to leverage more in my work.

Is this feeling of dissatisfaction normal for a first ""big"" job? Should I wait and see if the opportunity for a more engaging role opens up here, or start working on my portfolio and looking for something more aligned with my interests? Any advice would be appreciated!

Thanks in advance! And advice that you give as well is much appreciated.","Stuck on career advancement

However, I’m seeing entry level jobs with 6-10 years required which to me is insane. At that point that’s definitely a senior role and should not be listed as entry level.

Another thing Job opportunities mess up in is specifying onsite or remote based work. I can’t tell you how many jobs out there say remote but upon further reading of the job description or filling out an application there then reads “must be onsite”. If it’s a remote job then make it remote, don’t lie to others unless the company offers both. 

I’m only a year in IT doing help desk but I’m seeing GRC specialist, network engineers, etc being laid off and struggling to find a job. Companies really need to hire more people who will put the time in and strengthen an organization. Yet companies are cheap and not hiring more people or a manager wants someone who has years of experience but not enough to make the hiring managers themselves look bad.

I have a lot of law enforcement, some doctors, and others in my family and I’m really stating to regret picking the IT route. Not because it’s boring since I find technology to be fascinating but due to the fact that if this is the job market for the coming years I’d hate to have to work 10 years just to finally get a better job in a specialization.

Some back story - I've been working as a SOC analyst for about close to \~7 years now. I worked my way up from Tier 1 to Tier 3 with a vast range of experience from your basic triage, to standing up and fine-tuning, various EDR and SIEM solutions, to supporting/investigating IR/DR engagements. 

About 2 years ago, I left the MSSP scene - idk call it retiring from the front lines I guess - I decided to clam down and go from focusing on multiple clients to just one.  I took a role supporting a local medium sized company and everything was going well. Fast-fwd about 6 months the company was bought out by a rapidly growing ""tech company"". keep in mind the company is leaps a head in all of the other aspects just severely lacking in IT dept.

I'm sure you all know how these kinds of acquisitions go and the technical nightmare that comes with them.

  
Ok enough of me, I work at a company that has grown exponentially way too fast and senior IT leadership doesn't want to fix or address any underlying issues that i am seeing a problem in regards to our cybersecurity posture.

This will likely be long and sorry😅

Some back story - I've been working as a SOC analyst for about close to \~7 years now. I worked my way up from Tier 1 to Tier 3 with a vast range of experience from your basic triage, to standing up and fine-tuning, various EDR and SIEM solutions, to supporting/investigating IR/DR engagements. 

About 2 years ago, I left the MSSP scene - idk call it retiring from the front lines I guess - I decided to clam down and go from focusing on multiple clients to just one.  I took a role supporting a local medium sized company and everything was going well. Fast-fwd about 6 months the company was bought out by a rapidly growing ""tech company"". keep in mind the company is leaps a head in all of the other aspects just severely lacking in IT dept.

I'm sure you all know how these kinds of acquisitions go and the technical nightmare that comes with them.

  
Ok enough of me, I work at a company that has grown exponentially way too fast and senior IT leadership doesn't want to fix or address any underlying issues that i am seeing a problem in regards to our cybersecurity posture. I'm going to try and articulate my issues - Maybe I'm just young and dumb I don't know anymore 😅maybe im just burnt out and tired

Before the analyst joined the company, I applied for the in-house role but was denied due to lack of experience. At the time, I was a help desk technician with a little over a year of experience, but I already had my Network+ and Security+ certifications and was investing a lot of time in studying cybersecurity.

A few months after the analyst was hired, my Help Desk manager (my direct report) informed me that he was working with the ISO to create a dual-role position for me, splitting my time between the security team and help desk. The idea was to have me as a backup for the analyst, so that if he decided to leave, I could potentially move into his role. I’ve now been in this position for eight months, and my responsibilities have shifted to being almost entirely security-focused. I handle various projects alongside the analyst, and he relies on me for several tasks. During this time, my pay increased from $19/hour to $22/hour.

Even though I primarily work with the security team, I’m still not officially part of it and continue to report directly to the Help Desk manager. I also have to handle help desk tasks when needed. With the team currently understaffed and interns getting ready to leave, I’m concerned I might be asked to take on more help desk work until new techs are hired—distracting me from my security responsibilities.

I’m looking for advice on how to approach the ISO about officially joining the security team as a Junior Security Analyst. I also plan to request a small pay increase. 

How would you recommend framing this conversation? 

What key points should I highlight when discussing my contributions and value to the security team? 

Are there any potential pitfalls I should be aware of when making this request? My manager said he would back me on this.","How Should I Approach Asking for a Promotion to Junior Security Analyst?

At the time, I was a help desk technician with a little over a year of experience, but I already had my Network+ and Security+ certifications and was investing a lot of time in studying cybersecurity.

A few months after the analyst was hired, my Help Desk manager (my direct report) informed me that he was working with the ISO to create a dual-role position for me, splitting my time between the security team and help desk. The idea was to have me as a backup for the analyst, so that if he decided to leave, I could potentially move into his role. I’ve now been in this position for eight months, and my responsibilities have shifted to being almost entirely security-focused. I handle various projects alongside the analyst, and he relies on me for several tasks. During this time, my pay increased from $19/hour to $22/hour.

Even though I primarily work with the security team, I’m still not officially part of it and continue to report directly to the Help Desk manager. I also have to handle help desk tasks when needed. With the team currently understaffed and interns getting ready to leave, I’m concerned I might be asked to take on more help desk work until new techs are hired—distracting me from my security responsibilities.

I’m looking for advice on how to approach the ISO about officially joining the security team as a Junior Security Analyst. I also plan to request a small pay increase. 

How would you recommend framing this conversation? 

What key points should I highlight when discussing my contributions and value to the security team? 

Are there any potential pitfalls I should be aware of when making this request?

So for some context, I (24M) have been working for this retail company in Australia for around 4-5 years, however I started out in their warehouse as a packer for a majority of those years. During that time, I transferred from doing a course in Mechatronic Engineering to Cyber Security and never looked back. In my final year of University, I needed to get out of that toxic warehouse space, as it was time to look further into where this degree can take me and where my hard work could pay off. I was the top performing student in my degree for two consecutive years, so I was hoping to at least get an upper hand when applying for cyber security roles

Fast forward to today, and the only thing that got me a Cyber Analyst role still with this retail business is who I know, not what I know. I started talking with an older friend of mine who’s husband happened to work in the IT department and put in a good word for me, since she’s known me since I started working for this company and wanted me to succeed. I owe it all to them for this opportunity. I started out on help desk for around 3-4 months before seeing an open spot in the company for a junior cyber analyst, and here I am now

After a year since that has happened, I have learnt a lot of valuable skills within my role, as well as utilising some practices from university. However, I am now at a point where my manager has offered to fund any external training that I would like to do (given it gives value to myself and the company, and is not over $1000). From the past year, I’ve realised some strong points in our security posture, as well as some personal weak points. My manager made the suggestion that it would be viable to learn and master areas where our company does not have the experts on hand, so that I become more valuable as ‘that guy’ for a specific in our environment (for example: Mastering Microsoft Azure). This concerns me, as I hope that they would fund any certification I present to them, not only the ones that THEY want me to do since no one in the company is an expert in that area (for it only to be unique for this company and not another one).

My question is, given this opportunity and many routes, would it be best to stick to a certificate that may increase my knowledge of cyber security at a professional level from what I know OR focus on topics such as Microsoft Security and such? If so, what certifications are out there that not only can provide me beneficial information, but when I do eventually move on from the company, are recognised more in Australia by other businesses (even government), as I can take advantage of this funding that my manager has offered.

A feeling that all systems can collapse at any moment and all we can do is be a due diligent as possible, patch up where necessary, and get the right people to listen to how to secure the company without disrupting other processes. For example, if my security solutions do not work with another company it's done, we're scrambling. I feel overwhelmed but I also have the feeling to just keep going.

Another thought is that while cyber security is a 'sexy' term, the baseline here is that it is treated as any other field if not a bit immature and those who strive to keep learning will benefit from this field in the next 10 or so years.",been working now for   years and building my security team   it s hard and how do ya ll cope. i love security making sure bad things do not happen to a companies it is rewarding both monetarily and personally. trying to fix things when shit eventually goes wrong is also tough. i started my own outfit   years ago and i ve been doing sales marketing consultation hiring my own soc analysts for regular monitoring of companies systems and hopefully i can offload more tasks as i go. i won t lie i ve broken down many times. i ve learnt how the lack of regulations in cyber security creates this wild west feeling in cyber security but that could mean i am going in the wrong direction does anyone have any advice on this does anyone else feel like this in cyber security a feeling that all systems can collapse at any moment and all we can do is be a due diligent as possible patch up where necessary and get the right people to listen to how to secure the company without disrupting other processes. for example if my security solutions do not work with another company it s done we re scrambling. i feel overwhelmed but i also have the feeling to just keep going. another thought is that while cyber security is a sexy term the baseline here is that it is treated as any other field if not a bit immature and those who strive to keep learning will benefit from this field in the next    or so years.,1,0,1417,1400,2024,9,Monday,9,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1f72fmd/been_working_now_for_5_years_and_building_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1f72fmd/been_working_now_for_5_years_and_building_my/,1,0.679572285151168,0.679572285151168,SVM (Linear)

I’m a 27-year-old feeling a bit lost and confused, and I could really use some advice or insights from those who’ve been in a similar position.

Last year, I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Information Technology, specializing in Information Systems Security. Security is something I’m truly passionate about, and I’ve gained a decent amount of knowledge in this field. I’ve taken courses in ethical hacking and penetration testing, and I’ve learned to use several tools. While I’m not at a professional level yet, I feel confident navigating these tools.

One area where I struggle, though, is programming. It wasn’t my strong suit in university, and I still find it challenging. I’ve taken courses in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and while I enjoyed learning them, I realized that coding isn’t really my thing. My goal is to pursue a career in cybersecurity—specifically as a SOC analyst, a penetration tester, or in any role that doesn’t heavily rely on coding.

I understand the importance of coding in cybersecurity, and I can read and understand code to some extent. However, I struggle to write code from scratch without needing to research extensively.

Despite these challenges, I know I have a lot of practical knowledge. I’ve set up home labs and practiced what I’ve learned. I recently studied for the CompTIA Core 1 exam to strengthen my understanding of hardware, cables, and connections—areas where I initially felt weak. This has helped me fill in some gaps, and I’m grateful for the progress I’ve made.

My main challenge now is figuring out how to present what I know on my CV. I find it difficult to articulate my knowledge without overwhelming the reader with too much information. At this point, I’m eager to land any entry-level job in the field, just to gain some experience since I don’t have any professional background yet.

The uncertainty of trying to break into the industry has been weighing on my mind for a while now. I believe I have something valuable to offer, but there are times when I feel lost, and it leads to moments of self-doubt and frustration.

If anyone has advice on how to get started in cybersecurity, particularly with building a resume or finding an entry-level position, I’d greatly appreciate it. How did you navigate these early stages of your career? Any insights or tips would mean a lot to me.

I'm a former BE engineer, 3 years ago I joined a well funded life-sciences startup (55 people).  Just under 1 year ago the CTO (pleasantly) noticed I was doing a significant amount of the AWS security, policy, regulatory/compliance, and incident management... tada I became the InfoSec manager.  There has always been a fractional vCISO.

I've been reporting to the CTO for 5+ months, and coordinating work/incidents/policy with our GC and vCISO.  But the CTO is clearly not happy with me.  I'm an overachiever and previously never had 'partially meets' on performance evals, but I just had a heavy 'partial' review.  My weekly 1:1's with the CTO are fraught with the CTO's frustrations: ""you aren't communicating a plan"", ""you aren't keeping stakeholders informed"", ""it sounds like you have made some decisions in the last week, so you need to prove my own opinions wrong.""

There's a lot of plates to keep spinning: policy redlines, vendor security reviews, customer obligations/negotiations, CICD hardening, AWS/IaC monitoring+remediation, incident management + retros, SOC2 controls, constantly refactoring IAM, filling in for the Infra/DevOps team, and always prototyping+trialing data security products.  I am a very organized person (I hang on to jobs for a while because I dig in).

I was legitimately excited to exit a BE role, and could see myself getting into InfoSec/CyberSec/CISO.  But at a small company it seems the surface area is just very big for one person, and I'm never going to satisfy the CTO in an InfoSec role.

Lastly, my paranoia of being 'out on a ledge', as I'm nearly the only person without direct reports (except a co-op which I negotiated for) who reports to the CTO.  I'm paranoid of having no other peers or 'buttressing'/support in the org chart.

I work at a small company and have been there for a little over 2 years. This is my first full-blown security position and I love it – I wanted to get into security for a long time before this and have done security as a hobby for years.

I love where I work. I have a small team and my managers are the best I've ever had. I've been working in IT for nearly 15 years so I've been around enough to know they're truly amazing. I have no complaints about my job. I get to have my hands in nearly everything and the leaders teach me extremely valuable stuff, not just about security but about high-level office politics, things like that. My gripe is my senior. He doesn't deserve to be a senior. He's not a technical person, and he's not experienced enough to be there. His work ethic is horrible and he's rarely even online. When he is, he's often out and about, not at home at his station. On nearly every project, and I unfortunately mean on nearly every project, I have to step in and take over because he's not capable of finding the proper solution for our goal or incapable of troubleshooting something basic like even looking at Okta system logs to see what went wrong...

I started putting myself out there for Engineering level positions about a month ago on LinkedIn and the level of interest in me has been nice to see. I've been talking to recruiters and have gotten two interviews (different opportunities), and I have another call with a new recruiter tomorrow for yet another opportunity. The first one didn't work out, but I'm glad about it. The hiring manager interviewed me for 45 minutes, kept asking me questions on how I do things and I was knocking them out, but in the end his excuse to the recruiter was that he was ""worried the role would be boring for me and that I'd leave after finding something more interesting."" But I didn't like the guy or the company's situation (large distribution company around for over 40 years and has no dedicated security team, even a SOC) so I am glad that didn't work out. I'm not in a rush to leave anyway and am super happy where I am, so wherever I go will have to be perfect for me to leave what I have now. I have another round 1 interview later this week for a different opportunity and this one is more related to IAM and managing external identities with Auth0, which I haven't really done, though we have Auth0 where I am now, it's just not fully integrated into our portals yet. I'm concerned about this interview because I think it'll mostly be about that, but I know I can do the job, I just need to spend some time with Auth0 to get to know it like I do Okta, but I learned Okta pretty quickly and easily.

I don't know why I'm even typing this. I'm just nervous maybe, because WHEN I land my next job, my family's lives will change. But at the same time, I'm nervous because I don't have the confidence I usually have in interviews because I only have 2 years of directly related experience in security, but the thing is that I have such a technical mindset and learn so quick that I know I can do the job successfully, but of course on the hiring side it's a bit different hearing that lol. I don't know... I know eventually I'll land one of these jobs. I have to, right? Wish me luck.

Hey all,

I'm currently an IAM & IT Security Analyst making nearly $80k. Been in IT nearly 15 years, came from IT Support, System Administration, and then IT Management. I work at a small company and have been there for a little over 2 years. This is my first full-blown security position and I love it – I wanted to get into security for a long time before this and have done security as a hobby for years. I don't consider myself a master or leet by any means, but I do love this stuff, like I seriously LOVE this stuff. I guess I know more about the blue side than the red side, though the red side is where I want to be, but my career is not taking that direction and I feel like if I try, I will lose a big chunk of salary for starting over.

Like many people I went to college for something that I did not end up getting a job in. All of college was development, coding coding and more coding. Shortly after college I managed to land a job as an entry level penetration tester. Honestly it was a stroke of luck to find a company willing to hire me with not security experience but I jumped on it and learned as fast as possible.

I didn't get any huge certifications but poured everything into hands-on experience. It's now a few years later and I'm realizing I just do not want to commit my everything to this field. I thought it was imposter syndrome at first but I'm realizing that I am one of the people that other reference when they say ""OffSec is not for casual cyber folk"". I've learned all the basics of webapps, know my way around an active directory pentest, and I'm extremely experienced in social engineering.

I haven't done any development since college because we don't get dev time for tools and since I skipped right to OffSec I have no hands-on blue team experience. I'm currently applying for OffSec positions and blue team jobs all over but my resume isn't amazingly impressive. 

Really I'm just looking for any guidance on where people think I should move next as I feel stuck in this limbo. I write this as I sit at an airport flying to a client site kind of as a last ditch effort to find a direction. All advice or criticism is welcome.

You inevitably wear a lot of hats in startup world, so I’ve been fortunate enough to lead a ton of projects and have learned a crazy amount in a short period of time. 

To name a few achievements, I’ve built ISO 27001 and SOC 2 programs, led IdP migrations, MDM migrations, dozens of new SaaS rollouts and system migrations, security awareness training programs, scaled documentation, cost savings initiatives, etc. 

Love my company, my role, and really enjoy the  startup experience.

With that said, I’ve never really had an IT or Security leadership mentor in these roles. I’ve worked at companies with less than 500 employees, so I’ve never reported to a VP of IT/Security or CISO/CIO. I’ve spent the last 3 years reporting to Executives with other focus areas and while I get amazing support, I’m mostly learning on my own and digging into issues and then proposing projects. 

My goal is to one day become a CISO in the tech startup world, but I worry that I’m missing out on learning from seasoned Security/IT leaders. 

Do I need to consider moving to a larger org or are there other avenues to seek this type of mentorship? I’m connected with some CISO’s on LinkedIn, but haven’t yet reached out to anyone. Where do the CISO’s hangout lol.

1ff84y9,cybersecurity,HowAarya,2024-09-12 17:24:53,1726161893,I’m tired of applying for jobs (rant),"I’m so done. I’ve applied to 1000+ jobs in the last 10 months and I’ve only gotten rejections. At this point I’m just so tired and stressed and anxious and depressed. I lost my job last November and I have been looking for so long. Trying everything I can. Reaching out to people on linked. Applying for jobs everywhere, all over the country. Getting referrals. I’ve gotten 2 interviews the entire year! I don’t know what to do anymore. 

Some context about me and my situation. I moved to America a few years back to do my masters in cybersecurity. I started working for a small company a little more than 2 years back on student visa and I hated it. I absolutely hated the company. I even started doubting my competency because of how they made me feel. And while that was happening I was dealing with visa issues. I got laid off mid process because they didn’t want to handle my visa issues and I wasn’t even sure my OPT would get renewed. Thankfully in the end my OPT worked out but I had lost my job. Now if you know anything about foreign student working in the US you will know how restrictive and difficult it is. You have to get a job in the field of your major.

This year I applied for a work visa. I very luckily got picked in the H1B lottery. So now my application is being processed and if all goes well I will receive it in October. Now so far I’ve been stressed about not getting a job. It’s hard to find a company that will sponsor my visa and the worst part is plenty of jobs require clearance. Now I know there are tons that don’t. But it’s hard to find a company that sponsors me AND doesn’t require clearance. And even if I find all that I just get rejected. 

I’m starting to really believe something is wrong with me. Maybe my resume is not good enough. But everyone I ask to review gives me only minor adjustments but says it’s pretty good. I don’t know what the problem is. People around me tell me it’s not you it’s the market but how can that be the case for so long. If I at least get an interview I can show you myself. If I don’t know something, I will learn said something. If I know it I will show you everything I know. But to not even get a chance to speak to a human is so disheartening. I reach out to tons of people on LinkedIn but hardly anyone responds. Why is it so hard to just talk to people. To get one chance?

Sigh, I started therapy to help me regulate my stress and anxiety but that’s gonna take time. I have become extremely socially anxious and I don’t even go out. Every time I step out of the house or meet someone I have to spend money and that stresses me out even more. Every time I talk to people they ask me how my job search is going or what have I been up to. There is only so many times I can say it’s still going just as or nothing much. And everyone gives me suggestions of what I should or should not do. I’ve tried every thing everyone has told me. Nothing helps. And I know they mean well but that’s all everyone talks about with me. I don’t want to hear it anymore unless it actually helps me. Also I feel like, if I don’t apply for jobs that day, I am doing nothing productive and I get stressed out. But that stress is also making me not want to do anything. I’m in my late 20s. Life should not be stressing me out this hard. 

I know this is a long rant and is all over the place but it’s been long brewing. 

TLDR: I have been looking for a job for months and it’s been stressing me out. 

Edit 1: Thank you everyone for your kind words and thoughts. It feels good to know someone hears me and understands me and that I’m not alone in this situation. I did not expect so many responses but I really appreciate every one of you.

1fh57t8,cybersecurity,g4l4x135,2024-09-15 05:22:35,1726377755,Seeking career advice ,"Hello all! Please be kind… I know this struggle might seem ridiculous to some but it’s something I’ve been dealing with for quite some time. 

I am currently a cybersecurity engineer and have been for nearly three years. I ended up in the role by accident. As I’m sure most of you know, being a cyber engineer requires lots of experience and it’s something people typically do towards the end of their career or at least mid level. 

Long story short, when I was first in the position I was extremely overwhelmed because not only did I have to learn a whole new system, I had to find cyber solutions for it. Now, three years in, I’m… well… bored….bored out of my fffff mind!

I get it, our jobs are supposed to fund our lifestyle. But to be honest, I have always wanted a career that was rewarding and fulfilling in some way. In my current role I’m not getting that at all.

Hello all! Please be kind… I know this struggle might seem ridiculous to some but it’s something I’ve been dealing with for quite some time. 

I am currently a cybersecurity engineer and have been for nearly three years. I ended up in the role by accident. As I’m sure most of you know, being a cyber engineer requires lots of experience and it’s something people typically do towards the end of their career or at least mid level. 

Long story short, when I was first in the position I was extremely overwhelmed because not only did I have to learn a whole new system, I had to find cyber solutions for it. Now, three years in, I’m… well… bored….bored out of my fffff mind!

I get it, our jobs are supposed to fund our lifestyle. But to be honest, I have always wanted a career that was rewarding and fulfilling in some way. In my current role I’m not getting that at all. I feel so underwhelmed now and just unmotivated. For context I have my bachelors in cybersecurity and security+ cert if that matters.

1fiew15,cybersecurity,Blueberryburntpie,2024-09-16 20:23:32,1726518212,Abruptly going from military to civilian cyber. I am unsure of my way forward,"I led a cyber operations team for 2 years. I did ""client management"" (e.g. politely prying needed information from uncooperative network managers when we were doing defensive cyber operations that their boss had signed off on), evaluating cyber training courses to help develop the training pipeline for enlisted cyber specialists and advising higher command on mission planning.

Unfortunately I did not have time to obtain a major certificate such as CISSP.

My next job was a non-cyber role on a ship. The closest roles that would be applicable to cyber security was my responsibility of personnel and physical information security administration (e.g. submitting security clearance report after someone did something illegal, and dealing with stuff such as people leaving safes opened overnight).

With recent developments in the military, if I stay in, my future job would be non-cyber for another 3 years. So I put in my resignation from active duty and a request to go to the reserves.

That does leave me a little less than a year before my final day in the military to prepare for the switch to civilian life. And that remaining time will still be incredibly busy for me due to the ship's deployment schedule.

Two options I can think of right now:

- Pursue a master's in cyber or IT related field. One of my parents is a long-time employee at an university that offers a 50% tuition discount for their children. Combined with the GI tuition assistance (currently enrolled in the Montgomery version, haven't decided if I wanted to switch to post-9/11), that makes the degree essentially free. This does require me to study for GRE or GMAT.

- Take an extended time off to obtain cyber certificates and then apply for jobs.

Any recommendations?","Abruptly going from military to civilian cyber. I am unsure of my way forward

This consulting firm is one of the largest in my city, with around 500 employees, and has been in operation for over 20 years. Before landing the SOC Analyst role, I was working as a Help Desk technician at the same company for about six months. When the opportunity arose to join the SOC team, I volunteered for the position. The SOC itself has been running for less than a year—it's a long-term project, and right now, we have only three clients who have signed up for the service. A government organization in my country allocated a relatively large budget (around 3 million dollars) to establish the SOC, mainly to support small and medium-sized businesses. Although we already have clients, the SOC is still in development.

Currently, the team consists of three SOC Analyst L1s, two L2s, and four other people working more on the infrastructure side of the SOC, supported by the budget I mentioned earlier.

On my first day, one of my colleagues walked me through the infrastructure and tools we use. I handled a few alerts, and to be honest, there are very few alerts—enough that one or two L1 analysts could easily manage them without needing extra help. He also told me that alerts are rarely escalated to L2; most of them involve IPs trying to scan ports or brute-force their way into a service. The rest of the alerts are more informational, like if a user suddenly deletes a large number of files from their device or erases a lot of emails.

Honestly, I find the SOC quite lacking in terms of alert activity, and I’m concerned that I won’t be learning much here… I'm not sure if this is normal or not.

I'm debating whether to stay for a few more months to gain experience as an SOC Analyst and then look for a job elsewhere. Right now, my only experience is six months in Help Desk. I have the Security+ certification, and I plan to take the CySA+ at the end of the year.

Maybe I'm rushing things and expecting too much too soon, but the SOC gives me the impression of being a somewhat neglected service within the organization. I see half-written documentation, some outdated resources, and unclear procedures. It feels like there's no one really overseeing the SOC closely.","I'm having doubts after my first day as SOC Analyst L1

So, here’s the deal: I got laid off about a month ago, and I’ve been in full-on job-hunting mode since then. I’ve spent about 5 years in Security—mostly SAP Security (4.5 years) at company A and the last 6 months in GRC (Infosec) company B before I got laid off abdruptly. And...I’ve realized GRC isn’t my thing. I’m way more into the action-packed stuff like Threat Hunting, Security Engineering, Blue/Red Teaming, etc.

Am I 100% sure I love this path? Not exactly. But I *know* I don’t want to go back to SAP Security or GRC. Chasing people for evidence requests, drafting policies, and emailing vendors for audit reports... not my idea of fun.

**What do I bring to the table?** CISSP and CCSP certified, plus I’m pretty good at automating boring security tasks using Python (because who doesn’t love avoiding repetitive tasks?). I pick up new stuff quickly, but it’s still not enough to wow recruiters.

**Here’s where I need your help:** I want to pivot into the more exciting side of security—any good YouTube channels, courses, or free labs I should check out to level up in Threat Hunting and Red Teaming?

Also, how can I build a story for recruiters that shows I know what I’m talking about without having direct experience in those areas? Something like, ""I haven’t done it, but here’s how I know my stuff."" I’m interested in automating security tasks but not hardcore development like building websites.

Quick background: Early 30s, graduated with a B.S. in Cybersec a few years ago. Final four semesters were also spent working as a student mentor for a government funded grant program given to my school to host a college-level credit offering ""cybersec intro"" course for high school students (only noting this as a CIA rep I spoke to said this is highly appealing to any govt-sector hiring process). 

Was hired shortly after graduation by my current company. Began as an L1 SOC analyst for our at the time newly stood up managed service platform as an original member since day 1 - so I've seen it grow through all its ups and downs.

In terms of exposure, have gotten to experience some pretty cool things in this regard. Time spent here was obviously pretty basic ticket work but I personally liked to dive into things to the best of my ability which stood out.

  
Quickly earned a promotion to L2 within the year, which I found to be ""the spot"", felt like I was doing meaningful (at least more than now) work, was getting deeper hands-on experience in client environments, tools, etc. and was being handed client requests and incidents for deeper work, much of which received accolades.

But, I want to do security...work now consists of all the behind-the-scenes BS that I'm sure many of us are familiar with, 20 meetings a day, upper mgmt starting and stopping new projects every week, senseless reviews and audits for busy work, tasks that should be ahem cough automated, it's just become a total slog. Been at this role now for roughly 7-8 months and realistically, the only way forward, is yet an even more management-heavy role which I do NOT want. Management is not something I desire to do in any way, I just know this about myself and have no interest in further moving into mgmt in any capacity. Which brings me to this consideration to change careers. 

""Look into incident response, threat hunt/intel, risk"" you might suggest. Sadly have, and unfortunately, at least within my current company, these are not viable. IR and Threat are either outsourcing(ed) to our India teams explicitly or have a hire-freeze in place. Additionally, they all route through each other in some capacity so without one it's basically impossible to move into another, thus starts the loop again of need job for experience can't get job without experience. Simply put, I was essentially told it's not going to happen, and do not have enough confidence that it will to wait around for it.

  
This brings me to \*why\* I'm staying: six figure remote work, four day work weeks, robust benefits, and including holidays about 8 weeks PTO/year. It feels borderline stupid to even consider leaving but at what point does burnout exceed the benefits?

Criminology interests me greatly and I've considered school again (though not my first choice ideally, at least not another four years) to pursue a criminology/forensics degree to tie into security. Had basic exposure to law and forensics tools and processes in college, nothing that I would list as meaningful for a job application, but I highly enjoyed what I experienced. However, I'm very unfamiliar with that move process without some form of LEO or law-aligned experience. A note: I can get vouchers for SANS and similar training through work assuming it fits my role, but seeking unrelated training will throw up some flags. Considered pursuing my GCIH via SANS, as that fits my current role but also outreaches into others. 

  
At the end of the day I truly love my team, and while I certainly don't hate my job, it has become very unfulfilling. Unfortunately feels as though my path either has me continuing at my company and moving into management which I do not want, or seeking work elsewhere, which I also do not want and therein lies the dilemma. Leaving current benefits is ultimately the deciding factor, or at least finding comparable.

Open to thoughts, open to considering further education, certs (while I don't hold these as highly as others) and training ideas are welcome.

I’m a mid-level software engineer and my day to day work is on front end and occasionally I work on micro-services. I did however take a threat modeling course that detailed the overall process but my knowledge about security threats is lacking as well as my overall analysis of software architecture. 

The threat modeling just felt awkward as I just slowly went through our diagram and data flow. I just had basic security threats that I suggested but as soon as we dived a little deeper into network details, or specific cloud services I was lost. I had barely anything to contribute to continue the conversation. I did my best to record what was said.

It also felt like devs were going down tangents and I tried to bring it back to threat discovery but it felt weird just glossing over potentially something that needed to be talked about for the overall application design. 

Is that how threat modeling goes for a first timer? I think the overall idea behind it is great but a lot of the information out there is how you go about threat modeling and not necessarily any exact details. I did try to copy some case studies on the awesome threat modeling github repo but don’t think it helped my scenario much. How did you get better at it? Is it normal to feel somewhat clueless when going through this?

I’m a mid-level software engineer and my day to day work is on front end and occasionally I work on micro-services. I did however take a threat modeling course that detailed the overall process but my knowledge about security threats is lacking as well as my overall analysis of software architecture. 

The threat modeling just felt awkward as I just slowly went through our diagram and data flow. I just had basic security threats that I suggested but as soon as we dived a little deeper into network details, or specific cloud services I was lost. I had barely anything to contribute to continue the conversation. I did my best to record what was said.

It also felt like devs were going down tangents and I tried to bring it back to threat discovery but it felt weird just glossing over potentially something that needed to be talked about for the overall application design. 

Is that how threat modeling goes for a first timer? I think the overall idea behind it is great but a lot of the information out there is how you go about threat modeling and not necessarily any exact details. I did try to copy some case studies on the awesome threat modeling github repo but don’t think it helped my scenario much. How did you get better at it? Is it normal to feel somewhat clueless when going through this?",first time threat modeling i had to facilitate and host threat modeling with lead architects devs and i don t think i did a good job. i m a mid level software engineer and my day to day work is on front end and occasionally i work on micro services. i did however take a threat modeling course that detailed the overall process but my knowledge about security threats is lacking as well as my overall analysis of software architecture. the threat modeling just felt awkward as i just slowly went through our diagram and data flow. i just had basic security threats that i suggested but as soon as we dived a little deeper into network details or specific cloud services i was lost. i had barely anything to contribute to continue the conversation. i did my best to record what was said. it also felt like devs were going down tangents and i tried to bring it back to threat discovery but it felt weird just glossing over potentially something that needed to be talked about for the overall application design. is that how threat modeling goes for a first timer i think the overall idea behind it is great but a lot of the information out there is how you go about threat modeling and not necessarily any exact details. i did try to copy some case studies on the awesome threat modeling github repo but don t think it helped my scenario much. how did you get better at it is it normal to feel somewhat clueless when going through this,46,8,1443,1433,2024,9,Friday,2,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1fl23v8/first_time_threat_modeling/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1fl23v8/first_time_threat_modeling/,1,0.5225673012270406,0.5225673012270406,SVM (Linear)

Pathetic, I know. I’m not the best at anything other than art and that’s not a career path I trust too much. I have 3 more classes till I’m done with the cyber security program at my local college, BUT I haven’t taken any actual certs.

I’ve been psyching myself out, and since I have no experience whatsoever in tech, I haven’t really grasped anything in any of the classes I’ve taken. Each class is about 3-4 months and to me that’s really fast paced. It’s really getting to me that I’ve “gone this far” with nothing to show for it. School has never been my strong suit, and in the past I’ve tried other career paths, went to school, and would drop out, or fail and never end up trying again. 

I really want to finish something in life And my family is helping me financially with this program so me staying in this program is the only option. 

I really need some motivational words (roast me) so I won’t slip into depression. And also if anyone has a very… descriptive… roadmap for dummies guide, that would really help too.

I’ve been working as an SAP IDM consultant for over three years, but with the recent announcement that SAP IDM will be sunset in 2027, I’m at a bit of a crossroads in my career. The current SAP IDM environment I’m dealing with is extremely customized, full of legacy code, and completely lacking documentation, making it a very frustrating and stressful experience. I don’t have any issues with identity management as a concept, but this setup has been challenging, to say the least.

When I joined my organization, I completed the Identity IQ Essentials training from SailPoint University, but I never got the chance to apply it in real-world projects. Now, with SAP IDM on its way out, I’m evaluating whether I should transition to another IAM product like SailPoint or Microsoft Entra.

At the same time, I have a strong background and a genuine passion for Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT). I hold certifications like OSCP, CRTP, and PNPT, and VAPT has been my primary focus and interest, even before I ventured into IAM. It’s what motivates me to keep learning and growing, even on the most challenging days at work.

Now I’m trying to decide whether to:

1. Continue in IAM: Should I upskill with a future-proof product like SailPoint or Microsoft Entra? Entra ID, although still evolving, seems promising and could open up opportunities in the Azure ecosystem in the coming years. SailPoint is well-established in the on-premises space, but I’m unsure how their cloud solutions will hold up in the industry. I’m wary of getting locked into another tool that might eventually become obsolete, just like SAP IDM.
2. Deepen My Expertise in VAPT: Since VAPT is where I have the most expertise and passion, should I focus on this field instead? It’s what excites me the most and aligns more closely with my long-term interests. I’m worried that if I invest more in IAM, I might end up in the same situation again, stuck with a product that’s on its way out or doesn’t align with my career goals.

I’m leaning towards keeping my IAM skills alive as a secondary focus, but in a more flexible, tool-agnostic way, while continuing to specialize in VAPT. Has anyone been in a similar situation, or have any insights on how to navigate this transition? I’d really appreciate any advice or experiences you could share!

I want to be someone people can trust and depend on to get things done. 

Through this, I found myself reaching the top of the pay scale as an individual contributor at my current org with a few years and transitioned into a cyber management role over a year ago. I was not necessarily prepared for this. I had no prior management experience and I did not really have a mentor, or a boss willing to share their knowledge with me.

1fokmwn,cybersecurity,sloppyredditor,2024-09-24 19:10:58,1727205058,Regarding burnout: Understanding WHY is paramount,"(Posting by request.)  
  
Burnout and Impostor Syndrome will happen several times in a security career. While many ask about *how* to overcome it, the real question is *why* *does this happen?*

IMO, the main reason is we have very demotivational work in a misunderstood field. Our field is powered by negativity, justified with skepticism, and influenced by those who don't work with us on a daily basis.

We stop bad things from happening. An exciting day at work usually involves a crime, e.g., the organization we've been tasked with defending was attacked. A good day usually means our designs worked, but nobody noticed because they were able to do their jobs.

Breaches are happening everywhere and nobody seems to get punished effectively for it. In fact, *some get jobs* - by the very government asking us to defend better - *because of it*.

Tech is evolving faster than any other field, innovative companies are trying to adopt it a few months after initial release, and we need to be at least 3 months ahead of it, which means researching beta releases and conceiving the guardrails for something that may not even be a thing.

On a personal relations level, we're not a fun group to work with. People don't like dealing with password changes, MFA, firewall rules that block them from uploading files to customers, mandatory email encryption, etc. because we get in their way.

Audits ain't fun: It's not what you did, it's what you can prove you did. You have to back up every claim with documentation, logs, etc., that you typically don't think about unless you've failed an audit before. The auditors rarely know the ins and outs of how much effort it takes to meet compliance (regardless of what some will say, it is not easy) and they've got the ear of the BoD.

Finally, there's the cost. Breaches are expensive, so we're expensive. It's not difficult to see why the CFO scrutinizes our expenses when there's not any revenue coming in from the cyber folks. As messed up as it sounds in this forum, it makes financial sense to weigh ""how much would the ransom cost?"" vs. ""how much do these 4 technologies to mitigate ransomware risk cost?""

When we get out of our rhythm and look at our own situation it's easy to stare off and ask ""why do I bother doing this?"" ...and **that's** when the burnout starts.

**So how do we counteract the above? By remembering the reason we wanted to do this in the first place. FIND YOUR WHY** (supporting your family? being on the edge of tech? protecting people?)**, print it, and use it for motivation.**

And, for the love of all things holy, have a sense of humor about it. Laugh or you'll cry.

The Simpsons did exactly that in ""[And Maggie Makes Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Maggie_Makes_Three).""","Regarding burnout: Understanding WHY is paramount

I had 4 years of experience as a developer and this was the opportunity to stay closer to my family. I loved my previous job and I enjoy coding.

At the momento I dislike working as pentester because I don’t like spending days writing reports. Sometimes, it feels like I’m just following a tutorial from someone who already found a vulnerability, just to check if it applies. Other times, I’m not familiar with the technology the product uses, and I don’t know what to do. Overall, I work alone and often feel lost in the complexity, as every time I have to test a different product. At least as a developer, I could become an expert in the tech my company was using.

I think to be performing good at my job because sometimes I spot bugs, mia configuration and I have published some cve.

Does pentesting become more enjoyable when you get better (e.g. get some certifications, gain more experience)? Or is it just as this? I mean, when developing something you get that feeling of accomplishment, while pentesting for me it is like a quality assurance job, especially when you do not have the source code ( in my case I never have it) and it is impossible to become a security expert on something as the next product is totally different?

After losing my job, I have been sending out a large amount of applications but I'm running into an issue where I don't qualify for the GRC certifications needed to continue down that career path as I only have 1 year experience, and I don't have as much SOC experience since I was hired for a SOC/IR role then moved to GRC after 2-3 months due to business needs.

What should I do here?  How do I make myself more employable?  I have a Master's Degree in Information Security, my Sec+ and am working on my CySA+.  I don't qualify for my CISSP until I get another 2 years of work experience. Or do I have to say I'm SOL and go back to help desk and build myself back up?

At the beginning of August, I lost my previous job at an MSSP as a GRC Analyst.  For a large chunk of that time I had been working on call for the company in a more traditional IR role as well.  After losing my job, I have been sending out a large amount of applications but I'm running into an issue where I don't qualify for the GRC certifications needed to continue down that career path as I only have 1 year experience, and I don't have as much SOC experience since I was hired for a SOC/IR role then moved to GRC after 2-3 months due to business needs.

What should I do here?  How do I make myself more employable?  I have a Master's Degree in Information Security, my Sec+ and am working on my CySA+.  I don't qualify for my CISSP until I get another 2 years of work experience. Or do I have to say I'm SOL and go back to help desk and build myself back up?  I'm already in my mid-30s so that feels like I'd be locked out of security for good at that point...

I have the opportunity to move into our deployment team next year, who deal with the onboarding of customer infrastructure and tools into our platform, they do a lot of the high level design work with the customers to get them onboarded.

My end goal is security architect, but when im looking at those iob roels, they always want experience. So would my previous and current experience help with getting one of these roles even without direct architect experience? what would you recommend i focus on to try and stand our when eventually applying for architect roles?

I’m a digital forensics engineering student in my final year. This summer, I completed my internship at a company that specializes in networking and implementing firewalls, IDS, IPS, etc. Let’s call it Company X. It’s a great place with very nice people.

They’ve offered me the chance to do my long-term internship with them during the second semester of my final year. I asked what I would learn and what my future role in the company would be if I stayed on. They said that during the internship, I would focus on networking and learn how to implement IDS, IPS, firewalls, and similar technologies—and my job afterward would involve the same work.

Here’s the thing: I’m passionate about cybersecurity, especially the blue team field. I’ve been learning the basics of cybersecurity mostly on TryHackMe, where I’ve completed the Pre Security path, Complete Beginner, Web Fundamentals, Jr Penetration Tester, and SOC Level 1. I’m also planning to take SOC 101 at TCM Security and get some hands-on experience with SIEM and SOAR, firewalls , etc .

Specifically, I want to focus on SOC analysis. I could potentially reach out to other companies that work in the SOC field to do my internship there. However, if Company X finds out, I’m worried I might lose both opportunities.

What should I do? Should I stick with Company X for my internship and possibly work with them afterward, or should I take the risk and explore other opportunities in the SOC field?","Should I Stay with My Current Internship or Explore Other Opportunities in the SOC Field?

1fsx1ua,cybersecurity,anonymoususer493383,2024-09-30 14:35:45,1727706945,Completely burnt out as a SOC Analyst,"Hi all,

I’m looking for some advice from some fellow experienced analysts.

I’m an L2 SOC Analyst with 2 years experience in a relatively small MSSP. 

We have < 10 customers, but deal with between 100 to 200 alerts a day.

There’s only ever one analyst on at any given time working these alerts, which means, in a 24 hour period, a singular analyst may deal with 100 alerts in a 12 hour shift. This also means you have no other analysts to talk to during your shift, and no staff whatsoever on weekends.

On top of this large amount of alerts, we only have 2 engineers. Some alerts have been awaiting tuning from other 9 months ago, but haven’t been touched. In total, there are nearly 1000 tuning requests in queue.

We’re expected to:

- Triage, investigate and escalate alerts
- Identify alerts for tuning and raise these to engineering
- Create, write and present monthly customer reports which are particularly detailed
- Create, write and detail threat models for existing and new customers
- Attend daily, weekly and monthly customer meetings to listen to their concerns and deal with as appropriate
- Create, write and present Threat Advisory releases as and when they are released
- Obtain qualifications in our own time

It’s extremely lonely, overwhelming and tiring. I often don’t take my allocated hour break so that I can meet the demands of the daily onslaught of tickets from various customers. 

There are no other analysts to communicate with, and rarely an L3 is present should you need to escalate or request assistance. I work a 12 hour shift completely alone, only contacted by seniors when they want even more work on-top of my daily tasks.

I’m a burn-out point, as is all of the other analysts. Raising these issues to seniors hasn’t resulted in any change, despite our concerns of overworking number of alerts to analyst ratio, lack of tuning and unrealistic expectations.

Lastly, I’m not learning anything either. It feels like a game of catchup with alerts, where I’m not investigating these to their full potential, simply to meet the demands of the amount of tickets.

Existing SOC Analysts, what does your day to day look like? Is this the normal SOC experience? Should I be looking for other occupation elsewhere?","Completely burnt out as a SOC Analyst

Even lower level IT work is hard to get with years worth of prior experience. To go into my background briefly, I worked most prior in incident response and monitoring (soc work at first infosec job 2022) and ""security system analyst"" (pretty much IAM and access mengement work) (at 2nd most prior job, 2023-2024) but was made redundant at my prior company back in mid July this past summer and have been applying to work since then until I got a offer last week and started this monday (fast turn around, which is shocking, especially in this economy and job market!)

Although my last two jobs were Information Security based (I have a MS in Cybersecurity) and the other jobs before those two were lower tier 1 and 2 level IT support (helpdesk) and deskside support that I have been working in for about 7 years now.

I applied to both a mix of Information security which is my goal to get back into again but also IT support positions just in case I couldn't find a Information security position in time and to hold me over while still looking for my ideal job in this tough job market.

Anyways, like everything else in this job market for searching for work now being the worst I've personally seen since 2008-2012, so I was desperate for anything as no one knows how long they would be out of work and unemployed.

I got an offer after a final interview last week and I took it as a backup and ""placeholder"" if I didn't secure the other final rounds of interviews for jobs that pay much higher with better and higher job titles. but the kicker was that I applied and interviewed for a IT Support tier 2 position with a salary range from $70,000-$88,000 but in the offer letter, they reduced the role to IT Support tier 1 at a set $30 an hour and said that I will be the sole IT employee at two small offices of just under 100 employees and only given one week of training from the current IT manager (who I will be replacing for his duties) who is leaving the company this Friday!

They didn't tell me that he was leaving during our interview or in the job description posted online and on their website. I found out that he would be leaving on Monday and I would be on my own to lead both this office and another one that is on the other side of town on my own and expected to travel to another city once a month to support that office as well. SMH They bait and switched and lied to me and now making me the sole IT person onsite but giving me the lowest title and pay, but the most amount of work. I'm still waiting to hear back from another position. I did a final round last week and am still applying for other work but should I bail? I'm angry that they put me into this corner and make me the sole person doing all this labor on my own for such low pay. The people at this company are very nice, but that isn’t going to help me financially as this position is a huge step down for me in pay and title, but I’m glad I have something to hold over for now.

I still want to go back to infosec, but I want to get the CISSP to be a better applicant as its much harder to secure anything atm and I'm stuck doing work for deskside and helpdesk, which isn't what I wanted this far into my career. 

Tl;dr: Job lied to me about pay and job title after interview and application stated higher ($10,000-$18,000 higher) salary. I am also the only IT person for two small offices in different parts of the time and expected to do managerial level IT support while working an entry level tier 1 support title and pay.

Also, I read the FAQ and believe this is within the framework provided. (hopefully, as I really need this interaction)

I am not here to be swayed away from this, nor will I be receptive to any attempt to add to the natural fear I already feel about recent and future events in my life. With that out of the way, I come here asking for any advice, tips, tools, secrets.. anything you have that will help me with what I am about to divulge below.

I want to start this by saying thank you, truly.

I currently have a full time job that I am dissatisfied with. I make enough money to support myself and my family, but at 31 years old, it is starting to feel truly dead-end. This feeling has been growing for some time of course, as most things do, and it is now to a crown.

Around a month and some days ago, I was lying in bed, incredibly ill. I was having fever dreams between episodes of Charmed, and for some reason or another began to ruminate on a recent experience in the workplace. My company, along with thousands of others, got caught in the CDK Global ransomware event. It was chaos like I have never seen, and it fascinated me. From there, I began to think about other things that have happened in the workplace, such as vendor imposters attempting to get pay card information, smart-key cloning and vehicle theft, invoice fraud, etc.

Somehow, this left me with a business idea. Before I could think further, I'm researching what business structure to use, legal interests surrounding the type of work, market research relative to the field, etc. I reached out to a few businesses I have working relationships with and I'm sitting here now with a two week trial run lined up that starts in a week. At the end of this run I will compile and present all data I have collected. If they like what they see, I will be drawing up a contract and officially serving my first client on January 1, 2025.  I have already selected my LLC name and DBA. My mission statement is cemented and I have my presentation materials nearly finalized. I have the forms to register as a foreign entity in the home state of my prospective client as well as my domestic paperwork. I'm fully in, and still reaching out to other businesses. I am stupid, but something is forcing me to keep doing this. I'm in deep, and I can't go back now. I have to keep going forward, failure be damned.

The business venture is pretty straightforward. It focuses on the human side of security. Specifically social engineering and risk-management. It will operate as a monthly service, with opt-in/out programs suited for the businesses needs. Throughout the month, my business will try to collect information from the company through various means such as phishing, phone calls, fake invoices, on-site asset risks, after-hours penetration tests, etc. Through each action, data will be recorded and compiled into a report consisting of gross risk, divided by category. Phone calls, photos of risked assets like keys, tools, documents will also be included. Positive reinforcement will be provided where the business does well, and training will be offered to individual new-hires and groups of existing employees when needed or requested.

So of course, with my reckless charge into starting a business in a field I have no business being a business owner in, I enrolled into school. I will be attending SNHU for a BA in Cybersecurity with a concentration in Data Analysis. I am fully aware that this is an incredibly demanding career path intellectually. I fully understand that I have no understanding. I am a blank slate. The only advantage I have for myself is that I've been playing with computers since I was a single-digit child. I have very little programming experience aside from HTML/CSS and a crappy language called Blitz+ that I used to make a b-tier Pong clone. I am fairly good at math because I don't just memorize formulas, I learn why they work, which helps me retain the ideas behind what different types of data reflect. I know that this line of work is something I am capable of doing, and feel I may enjoy.

When I was in my early twenties, I had no idea what I was doing, and so I let my life stagnate. The last 10 years has been a blur, but something has stirred in me and I can't stop it. I don't have any interest in stopping it, either. I have never been this motivated nor this scared before. It is like something awoke in me. Maybe it is because I went on a diet and got healthy this year, or because I had an idea and some took me seriously. Whatever it is, I have no interest in walking away, so if you can support me in my struggle to be more than I am today, share with me what you can.

  
I will be forever grateful, more than you may realize.

framework provided. i am not here to be swayed away from this nor will i be receptive to any attempt to add to the natural fear i already feel about recent and future events in my life. with that out of the way i come here asking for any advice tips tools secrets.. anything you have that will help me with what i am about to divulge below. i want to start this by saying thank you truly. i currently have a full time job that i am dissatisfied with. i make enough money to support myself and my family but at    years old it is starting to feel truly dead end. this feeling has been growing for some time of course as most things do and it is now to a crown. around a month and some days ago i was lying in bed incredibly ill. i was having fever dreams between episodes of charmed and for some reason or another began to ruminate on a recent experience in the workplace. my company along with thousands of others got caught in the cdk global ransomware event. it was chaos like i have never seen and it fascinated me. from there i began to think about other things that have happened in the workplace such as vendor imposters attempting to get pay card information smart key cloning and vehicle theft invoice fraud etc. somehow this left me with a business idea. before i could think further i m researching what business structure to use legal interests surrounding the type of work market research relative to the field etc. i reached out to a few businesses i have working relationships with and i m sitting here now with a two week trial run lined up that starts in a week. at the end of this run i will compile and present all data i have collected. if they like what they see i will be drawing up a contract and officially serving my first client on january       . i have already selected my llc name and dba. my mission statement is cemented and i have my presentation materials nearly finalized. i have the forms to register as a foreign entity in the home state of my prospective client as well as my domestic paperwork. i m fully in and still reaching out to other businesses. i am stupid but something is forcing me to keep doing this. i m in deep and i can t go back now. i have to keep going forward failure be damned. the business venture is pretty straightforward. it focuses on the human side of security. specifically social engineering and risk management. it will operate as a monthly service with opt in out programs suited for the businesses needs. throughout the month my business will try to collect information from the company through various means such as phishing phone calls fake invoices on site asset risks after hours penetration tests etc. through each action data will be recorded and compiled into a report consisting of gross risk divided by category. phone calls photos of risked assets like keys tools documents will also be included. positive reinforcement will be provided where the business does well and training will be offered to individual new hires and groups of existing employees when needed or requested. so of course with my reckless charge into starting a business in a field i have no business being a business owner in i enrolled into school. i will be attending snhu for a ba in cybersecurity with a concentration in data analysis. i am fully aware that this is an incredibly demanding career path intellectually. i fully understand that i have no understanding. i am a blank slate. the only advantage i have for myself is that i ve been playing with computers since i was a single digit child. i have very little programming experience aside from html css and a crappy language called blitz that i used to make a b tier pong clone. i am fairly good at math because i don t just memorize formulas i learn why they work which helps me retain the ideas behind what different types of data reflect. i know that this line of work is something i am capable of doing and feel i may enjoy. when i was in my early twenties i had no idea what i was doing and so i let my life stagnate. the last    years has been a blur but something has stirred in me and i can t stop it. i don t have any interest in stopping it either. i have never been this motivated nor this scared before. it is like something awoke in me. maybe it is because i went on a diet and got healthy this year or because i had an idea and some took me seriously. whatever it is i have no interest in walking away so if you can support me in my struggle to be more than i am today share with me what you can. i will be forever grateful more than you may realize. thank you

1fyvk0a,cybersecurity,Linguanaught,2024-10-08 09:16:26,1728378986,What is my real issue with Cyber?,"I've been in the Cyber space for 4-5 years now and I've worked at two branches within the same company that whole time. When I was in school for Cyber Security, I thought I was really going to enjoy the work. I'm the guy that my in-law's reach out to with tech problems or asking if an email is legit or not, I'm the one who advises my family about staying safe online, etc. This has spawned from my role as the Information Security Awareness, Training, and Phishing manager at my company - I love the role, mostly. I use to like it more. 

I have worked for this company for going on 5 years now in the same position, more or less, and at two different branches in the company which were in two different countries. I've moved my family across the world for this company. A large reason for the move was to get away from a toxic CISO at my old branch. Now that I've moved to this other branch, my new CISO has begun to show their true colors and is arguably worse than my former CISO. 

Both CISO's have \*said\* that they care about the employee - ""Burnout is real"", ""Take breaks"", ""Take Vacation"". But they proceed to get mad at their employees for the dumbest crap (had a coworker get berated in front of guests at a presentation where he couldn't remember the acronym he was using and our CISO proceeded to chew him out in front of everyone). I once ran a phishing simulation which had some false positives. It was later found out that this was caused due to bad data from HR which included employees that had been terminated for years (some of them were even passed away) when the previous month's lists were fine, meaning a backend change happened at some point and changed my reports without me being told. My CISO proceeded to announce how I was making them look bad, along with the team. By ""look bad"", I mean that the CISO said I was making us look like ""Shit"" - this was in an email with me to our COO. 

That was all just my old CISO. My new CISO yells at me for things like using the moving service that my company paid for to assist me with moving to Germany. Evidently I'm only supposed to use them for urgent things - but getting my new born son registered with the German government isn't urgent? Or cost too much for a multi-billion dollar company? Most recently, I was yelled at because I informed my CISO during a one-on-one that my son might be a bit loud in the background since my wife was putting our daughter to sleep, meaning my son wasn't being attended to. My CISO understood this to mean that I was busy watching my son. She told me how I need to prioritize work and blah blah blah. I ended up becoming so frustrated with my CISO that I was basically yelling at them explaining why what they said was so offensive and wrong. My CISO also would treat a former colleague as if they were the dumbest person my CISO had ever met, even though the colleague has worked in Cyber / Technology since the late 90's. Basically forced the colleague to quit - which they did after handing in a doctor's note saying they needed a week off because of mental stress from our CISO. 

So, I guess my question is: Is the Cyber industry just toxic or am I just unlucky? What are some good, non-technology fields to pivot to? Will the military take a 32 year old veteran still? Cause I'd honestly rather deal with the military again than deal with another CISO. ","What is my real issue with Cyber?

While it was a great learning experience working in a SOC as a threat analyst I feel like I have hit a wall. I work for a large MSSP and due to staffing shortages I have been doing mostly L1 work ( triaging alerts). I am so bored by the work and feel like I am on ""auto-pilot"" every day. Part of me feels like I am wasting my time as I am not learning anything new in my current position. However, I am not sure where to go from here. I've started looking for other jobs but have a bit of imposture syndrome when looking at the required skills/ years of experience in another cybersecurity domain. I can't help but feel like I am stuck in the SOC as that is where my experience lays.

  
Has anyone successfully transitioned from working as a threat analyst in the SOC into another area of cybersecurity?  

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",burnt out soc analyst where to go from here hello infosec community i am a burnt out sr. threat analyst that has been working in the soc for the past   years. a little background i changed career paths into cybersecurity   plus years ago and started working as a l  analyst in a soc as i heard that is a good starting point. i busted my butt working my way up to a l  analyst even have   months of being a soc manager experience. i have a master s degree in cybersecurity sec some vendor cloud certs and got my cissp earlier this year. while it was a great learning experience working in a soc as a threat analyst i feel like i have hit a wall. i work for a large mssp and due to staffing shortages i have been doing mostly l  work . i am so bored by the work and feel like i am on auto pilot every day. part of me feels like i am wasting my time as i am not learning anything new in my current position. however i am not sure where to go from here. i ve started looking for other jobs but have a bit of imposture syndrome when looking at the required skills  years of experience in another cybersecurity domain. i can t help but feel like i am stuck in the soc as that is where my experience lays. has anyone successfully transitioned from working as a threat analyst in the soc into another area of cybersecurity any advice would be greatly appreciated,1,0,1397,1354,2024,10,Wednesday,0,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1fzfhpo/burnt_out_soc_analyst_where_to_go_from_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1fzfhpo/burnt_out_soc_analyst_where_to_go_from_here/,1,0.6617131572880268,0.6617131572880268,SVM (Linear)

About us:

 - Saas, pure API, no UI, no site where users can login, just an API

 - Modern stack, AWS, GSuit, Slack, Github, etc

 - Three people team, two developers and one business person all remote

Reasonably paranoid about security, but not experts. We have a good understanding of the basics, but we are not security experts.

We need  the certification as a sales tool for some big corporate leads.

We would love someone who can practically do it for us. Someone who can say: for your business you should have thees policies, these controls, etc. Ideally be on with us also during the audit.

Thank you.

I'd like to know *everyones* advice on how to lead a small team in a SOC environment!

Background: 
- I'm 22yo
- Ive got only 11 months of SOC analyst experience in MSSP

I have just accepted an (unexpected) job offer for a new job at a new company. I don't know much about the role, however it pays much more than a standard SOC analyst position (and MUCH more than my previous entry level poisition). So it seems like I'll have quite serious responsibilities.
 It is a really interesting sounding role and what I know so far is that I will be the customer facing lead of a small team of 3, who have been called in to enhance and mature an existing SOC to prepare their team for a merge with multiple other SOCs.

I deeply respected the SOC lead at my last job, and I am concerned that I will not be able to match his excellence!

I understand that it will be my responsibility to enhance the workflow/processes etc (as well as tuning) and I want to understand your thoughts on how's best to do this? How should I manage a team? How do I adapt into this new fast paced environment which will surely take some time to come to terms with?

It did not.

I'm not saying the sec+ is a bad cert in fact I think it is probably the best beginner cert for this field and it absolutely can HELP get a job. I currently hold my sec, CySA, and PNPT and I will be taking my OSCP in the next few months so I am still mostly a newbie myself.

Now the reason I say it will not get you a job right away is because from my personal experience of applying to all sorts of entry cybersec positions across almost every industry is that, though yes the majority of them were asking for a sec+ they were also asking for 1-2 years of relevant experience OR a bachelors and no experience.

I still think if you are thinking about earning the cert you should as I learned a ton from it but don't do it expecting it to be a golden ticket into a entry level soc position.

Final thing is it definitely can help you get a position on an entry level IT help desk as it will set you apart from a lot of other candidates and the experience on the help desk looks good on a resume.

In argument theory, there's a concept of a false dichotomy. Within a false dichotomy, we assess that things can be good or bad. It's time to leave or stay. I'm burned out or I'm passionate. It's a natural human decision tree method, which makes decisions binary and - in some cases- that's easier than having options. (Un)fortunately, life is rarely so binary - despite our careers literally being about ones and zeroes.

I've been a community member here for a while across different accounts. On a given day, you'll see at least one post about ""HoW dO I bEcOmE a L33T H@xor wItHOuT DoInG mY oWn ReSeArCh?"" and it's balanced out with ""How do I get out?"". If it weren't so frequent that we see the same two posts day in and day out, it would be funny.

The goal of this post is to provide you options to assess what's in the decimal points between 1 and 0, and hopefully some of the tricks and strategies will help you.
  
### Tricks to be discussed:

- Challenge the status quo
- Diversify your value streams
- Intra-preneurship [Not a typo]

### Why Me?

Before I start, I want to give my obligitory ""why does my opinion matter?"". Brutally honest - it doesn't. This is just some more text in the world that's repeating great things others have said before. Ego inflating - I've launched and sold a successful security start up, worked for fortune 5 companies, and I'm an ex-lifeguard at the YMCA.

### Disclaimers

I'm not a mental health professional and the advice I'm giving should be taking with that in mind. There are mental health challenges, temporary or chronic, that may be associated with thoughts of being trapped into a situation. This advice is intended to be taken broadly and with a slab of salt.

### Challenge the Status Quo

I have yet to be in a single business where the processes were perfect, everything worked like a well oiled machine, and it was sunshine and rainbows. If you have a workplace like this, and you're reading this article, kindly go climb a tree. This is for the rest of us who live on earth.

With the status quo often comes things like routine, manual tasks that offer minimal value. There are standing meetings that don't make sense. There are boundaries that you aren't allowed to cross, even though the fix is right in plain sight. It can entrap you into a box of function that feels self defeating in many ways. On the other hand...

The status quo may come with such disorganized chaos that nothing is getting done. Everyone complains about issues all the time, but nothing is getting done about any of them. The backlog (if there even is one) is so long and out of date that the thought of prioritizing and executing it requires mental stamina that only tibetan monks have attained. It's crazy out there.

In either situation, I find that a lot of people stuck in the status quo feel helpless to change things and don't feel like they have options. Depending on the company, that may be true, but there are some things to try before giving up.

In any situations where you are challenging the status quo, it needs to be done with respect for why the tape (or chaos) is there. The best way to justify doing what you see as important is to understand the biggest pain points in the business and tackling them. This means talking with your management and other stake holders to see what's bothering them.

Once you have a good sense of the boundaries and challenges that exist, you can start to put together a strategy for dealing with them. Most boundaries are there for good reasons, but sometimes they need to be adjusted. This is where a proof of concept comes into play. Often times when I have an idea for a change, the most effetive way to get support is to put something in a decision maker's hand that shows the change. This could be a script, or a diagram, or a spreadsheet; it just needs to show the value you're bringing.

#### An anecdote --

Once upon a time, I worked at a large utility company and I'm pretty sure the entire thing was built with red tape. I've never spent more time or energy on documentation and process than I did at that organization, so it definitely fell into the first status quo definiton. While my time there was cut short by a certain pandemic, I was quite successful in my role ther and still have many good relationships from the role.

What helped me succeed in the role was doing what I knew needed to be done rather than waiting for a process to complete. The project needed a script built and the devs were busy? I wrote one. We needed to parse and analyze 16GB of logs a day and I had a 6th gen U processor to do it with? Time to learn rust. We needed a business primer on MFA methods? I crafted one. We needed a financial projection for different solutions? I built it.

Instead of being constrained to what my job title was, I actively filled gaps and drove success. I prioritized the biggest pain points and allowed the noisy red tape to whine in the background unless it really was urgent. Along the way, I built the relationships with key people in the organization who also wanted change but needed help showing the path forward.

On the flipside, I had a colleague who was such a rule follower, he genuinely struggled in his role. On top of that, his manager was quite strict in his persuit of delivery. For months I watched the colleague flail about, until one day I snapped at him. 

I pointed out that he wasn't likely going to be perfect at attaining all the written expectations for his role given the amount of tape. In that situation, demonstrating value by completing work was more important than being perfect at following the red lines. When he let go of trying to do everything by the book, and focus on getting things done he felt more empowered to do his job and was actually recognized for it. The manager who had been overbearing came to be trusting instead.

### Diversify your value streams

Originally, I had this section titled for income streams, but I realize that was a single minded approach. In reality, a lot of the times we feel stuck because we don't have other engagements in our lives. Those could be side hustles, hobbies, or community work but they should all be something that keeps you engaged in something else. This (then) excludes mindless activities that lead to less fulfillment, such as watching TV.

Now, I'm not attacking watching TV. There's a time and place for sitting in front of the screen and getting lost in a story or catching up on the news. However, activities like this or doom scrolling have been demonstrated to do little for our motivation and sense of fulfillment. In fact, at too much exposure they can demotivate and defalte our sense of self.

For me, I have found the freelancing keeps me well engaged. I get to learn and solve different problems, often for temporary clients so nothing to long or boring after a period of time. I've also donated a lot of time to local non-profits to support their IT and provide teaching to those who want to get into the field. All these activities are outside of my work hours and keep me engaged by forcing my focus onto other activities for a while. 

Note on the excuse of having families: I have one. Four kids, a disabled wife, and all the extras that brings. As the single income earner for the family, I do a lot to keep them taken care of, but I still make time to play Minecraft with the kids, build legos, build camp fires, etc. with them. Most of my side work is done early morning or after the kids go to bed.

### Intra-preneurship

Now, some of you don't want to or aren't allowed (by your employment agreement) to seek externaml work. In any case, I highly recommend at looking in your business and seeing if there are opportunities for you to take on responsibilities that align with your career goals and business need. With the exception of large enterprises (and even they have these gaps), there's more hats to be worn than people to fill them. Any start up people know this too well.

In the small-medium business category, if you really need a change of pace but like the people you're with, speak up. Create a business case for the change and demonstrate how you could make a difference in that area. You may find that you're able to build your own brand within the organization as the person who brings positive change. With the reputational growth comes increased trust and opportunity to change the status quo, drive value, and make a fulfilling career of your own chosing within the organizatoin construct. 

If you want to learn more about this specific topic, David Bet Patrick wrote a great book ""5 Steps Ahead"" that covers this and more. I recommend it.

### In Closing

These are just three techniques for fighting your sense of being trapped or stuck. Each of them allows you to create a decimal point between ""should I stay or go"" leading to options like:

- 0.0: Leave
- 0.2: Attempt Intraprenuership
- 0.5: Challenge the status quo
- 0.8: Diversify Value Steams
- 1.0: Stay

Good luck out there, and remember that jobs are a major factor in life and they aren't going to make you personally fulfilled 100% of the time. It's not any company's job to make you happy as an employee; and HR is there to make sure you're productive. This is all as it should be. Your fulfillment and happiness is largely depenent on your ability to control your response to situations. These strategies will help, and there are many others to choose from as well.","Dealing with feeling stuck in the security field

I've never spent more time or energy on documentation and process than I did at that organization, so it definitely fell into the first status quo definiton. While my time there was cut short by a certain pandemic, I was quite successful in my role ther and still have many good relationships from the role.

What helped me succeed in the role was doing what I knew needed to be done rather than waiting for a process to complete. The project needed a script built and the devs were busy? I wrote one. We needed to parse and analyze 16GB of logs a day and I had a 6th gen U processor to do it with? Time to learn rust. We needed a business primer on MFA methods? I crafted one. We needed a financial projection for different solutions? I built it.

Instead of being constrained to what my job title was, I actively filled gaps and drove success. I prioritized the biggest pain points and allowed the noisy red tape to whine in the background unless it really was urgent. Along the way, I built the relationships with key people in the organization who also wanted change but needed help showing the path forward.

On the flipside, I had a colleague who was such a rule follower, he genuinely struggled in his role. On top of that, his manager was quite strict in his persuit of delivery. For months I watched the colleague flail about, until one day I snapped at him. 

I pointed out that he wasn't likely going to be perfect at attaining all the written expectations for his role given the amount of tape. In that situation, demonstrating value by completing work was more important than being perfect at following the red lines. When he let go of trying to do everything by the book, and focus on getting things done he felt more empowered to do his job and was actually recognized for it. The manager who had been overbearing came to be trusting instead.

### Diversify your value streams

Originally, I had this section titled for income streams, but I realize that was a single minded approach. In reality, a lot of the times we feel stuck because we don't have other engagements in our lives. Those could be side hustles, hobbies, or community work but they should all be something that keeps you engaged in something else. This (then) excludes mindless activities that lead to less fulfillment, such as watching TV.

Now, I'm not attacking watching TV. There's a time and place for sitting in front of the screen and getting lost in a story or catching up on the news. However, activities like this or doom scrolling have been demonstrated to do little for our motivation and sense of fulfillment. In fact, at too much exposure they can demotivate and defalte our sense of self.

For me, I have found the freelancing keeps me well engaged. I get to learn and solve different problems, often for temporary clients so nothing to long or boring after a period of time. I've also donated a lot of time to local non-profits to support their IT and provide teaching to those who want to get into the field. All these activities are outside of my work hours and keep me engaged by forcing my focus onto other activities for a while. 

Note on the excuse of having families: I have one. Four kids, a disabled wife, and all the extras that brings. As the single income earner for the family, I do a lot to keep them taken care of, but I still make time to play Minecraft with the kids, build legos, build camp fires, etc. with them. Most of my side work is done early morning or after the kids go to bed.

### Intra-preneurship

Now, some of you don't want to or aren't allowed (by your employment agreement) to seek externaml work. In any case, I highly recommend at looking in your business and seeing if there are opportunities for you to take on responsibilities that align with your career goals and business need. With the exception of large enterprises (and even they have these gaps), there's more hats to be worn than people to fill them. Any start up people know this too well.

In the small-medium business category, if you really need a change of pace but like the people you're with, speak up. Create a business case for the change and demonstrate how you could make a difference in that area. You may find that you're able to build your own brand within the organization as the person who brings positive change. With the reputational growth comes increased trust and opportunity to change the status quo, drive value, and make a fulfilling career of your own chosing within the organizatoin construct. 

If you want to learn more about this specific topic, David Bet Patrick wrote a great book ""5 Steps Ahead"" that covers this and more. I recommend it.

### In Closing

These are just three techniques for fighting your sense of being trapped or stuck. Each of them allows you to create a decimal point between ""should I stay or go"" leading to options like:

- 0.0: Leave
- 0.2: Attempt Intraprenuership
- 0.5: Challenge the status quo
- 0.8: Diversify Value Steams
- 1.0: Stay

Good luck out there, and remember that jobs are a major factor in life and they aren't going to make you personally fulfilled 100% of the time. It's not any company's job to make you happy as an employee; and HR is there to make sure you're productive. This is all as it should be. Your fulfillment and happiness is largely depenent on your ability to control your response to situations. These strategies will help, and there are many others to choose from as well.",dealing with feeling stuck in the security field opening statement in argument theory there s a concept of a false dichotomy. within a false dichotomy we assess that things can be good or bad. it s time to leave or stay. i m burned out or i m passionate. it s a natural human decision tree method which makes decisions binary and   in some cases  that s easier than having options. fortunately life is rarely so binary   despite our careers literally being about ones and zeroes. i ve been a community member here for a while across different accounts. on a given day you ll see at least one post about how do i become a l  t h xor without doing my own research and it s balanced out with how do i get out . if it weren t so frequent that we see the same two posts day in and day out it would be funny. the goal of this post is to provide you options to assess what s in the decimal points between   and   and hopefully some of the tricks and strategies will help you. tricks to be discussed:   challenge the status quo   diversify your value streams   intra preneurship why me before i start i want to give my obligitory why does my opinion matter . brutally honest   it doesn t. this is just some more text in the world that s repeating great things others have said before. ego inflating   i ve launched and sold a successful security start up worked for fortune   companies and i m an ex lifeguard at the ymca. disclaimers i m not a mental health professional and the advice i m giving should be taking with that in mind. there are mental health challenges temporary or chronic that may be associated with thoughts of being trapped into a situation. this advice is intended to be taken broadly and with a slab of salt. challenge the status quo i have yet to be in a single business where the processes were perfect everything worked like a well oiled machine and it was sunshine and rainbows. if you have a workplace like this and you re reading this article kindly go climb a tree. this is for the rest of us who live on earth. with the status quo often comes things like routine manual tasks that offer minimal value. there are standing meetings that don t make sense. there are boundaries that you aren t allowed to cross even though the fix is right in plain sight. it can entrap you into a box of function that feels self defeating in many ways. on the other hand... the status quo may come with such disorganized chaos that nothing is getting done. everyone complains about issues all the time but nothing is getting done about any of them. the backlog is so long and out of date that the thought of prioritizing and executing it requires mental stamina that only tibetan monks have attained. it s crazy out there. in either situation i find that a lot of people stuck in the status quo feel helpless to change things and don t feel like they have options. depending on the company that may be true but there are some things to try before giving up. in any situations where you are challenging the status quo it needs to be done with respect for why the tape is there. the best way to justify doing what you see as important is to understand the biggest pain points in the business and tackling them. this means talking with your management and other stake holders to see what s bothering them. once you have a good sense of the boundaries and challenges that exist you can start to put together a strategy for dealing with them. most boundaries are there for good reasons but sometimes they need to be adjusted. this is where a proof of concept comes into play. often times when i have an idea for a change the most effetive way to get support is to put something in a decision maker s hand that shows the change. this could be a script or a diagram or a spreadsheet it just needs to show the value you re bringing. an anecdote    once upon a time i worked at a large

I work for a great company. They generally meet all of my needs. My position primarily focuses on detection engineering and incident response, with hints of cross-functional support depending on the business's needs.

But when my boss, the CISO, asked where I see myself in 5 years, I couldn't give him an answer.

Is it even a question worth answering? Maybe I'm right where I am 5 years from now, and maybe then I'll figure out what I want to do next. I don't know.

I am a penetration tester seeking a career pivot and would love advice on different potential paths, preferably sales role.

I would love to learn more from the perspective from my fellow security professionals.

**Background:**

I currently work as a penetration tester / cybersecurity consultant at one of the Big 4 consulting firms. I am from a non-technical degree, and I somewhat found my way into cyber by coincidence. I’ve been in this role for around 1.5 years since graduating, and I’ve spent a lot of time studying after work to catch up on technical skills, earn certifications (such as OSCP and Security+), etc. So far I’ve been doing well.

However, I don't find myself enjoying my current role. I don't have great passion for ""ethical hacking"" and ""security assessments"" (I hate GRC and audits with passion tho). Moreover, my seniors and managers are overworked (replying late at night and on weekends) and underpaid. I don't really see myself staying in this role for more than another two years.

**What I am looking for:**

At this point, compensation is my primary focus. I’m willing to grind while I’m still young - be it technical, networking, or even cringy LinkedIn stuff, but I am hoping for a better return on all my efforts. The technical grind just seems never ending, and I feel the rewards don’t justify the effort. I might be wrong, but that's why I'm here seeking advice.

Given the current state of the job market, I'm not looking to switch roles right away. My goal is to create a roadmap for the next 2-3 years to prepare myself for future opportunities.

**My Questions:**

How should I plan and prepare for my career? From what I’ve seen, staying long-term at a Big 4 firm feels like a dead end, and I know I’ll need to leave at some point. However, I’m unsure of which direction to take. Here are a few paths I’ve been considering:

*1. Sales Roles:*

This is my top choice so far. While I can handle technical work, I am also more of a people person (plus the fact that sales roles tend to pay better). I’m particularly interested in hybrid roles like Sales Engineering or Customer Success, but I would love to hear your thoughts on these options, as well as what I may do to work towards this direction.

*2. Security Engineer / DevSecOps:*

Another path that I see quite some pen-testers transition into. However, my current job offers little exposure to DevOps or SDLC, and my experience on the blue team side is limited.

*3. Managerial Roles:*

Grind in consulting till I reach manager and look for in-house security management roles. It looks like the most reasonable and stable path, but it also seems to have kept all the elements I dislike now.

*4. New Specializations:*

SWE, cloud, AI, blockchain, etc. I am confident that I can pick them up with time, but my concern is to start this whole cycle all over again.

I am quite lost at the moment and would greatly appreciate your input. Thank you all in advance!","Advice for pivoting out of Penetration Testing / into Sales Roles

I'm doing some field research and wanted to get insights from this community. Specifically, I’m curious to know how many product teams or businesses here have opted *not* to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for their users due to fears of negatively impacting conversion rates or lifetime value (LTV). Am talking only about businesses and industries which can benefit some flexibility like e-commerce, online cinemas/gaming etc.), definitely not healthcare/gov or finance fields which are a subjects for multiple regulations. 

• Are aware of any cases when business avoid MFA due to concerns about onboarding friction or losing potential customers?

• Do you know if anyone measured the actual financial impact of this decision, either in terms of security risks or product/business performance?

• Did you notice any improvements in user conversion or retention by not implementing MFA, and what were the long-term costs or benefits?

I know MFA is generally considered a security best practice, but I’m wondering how often business teams choose to forego it for the sake of growth, and whether those decisions were backed by data.

Hey folks,

I'm doing some field research and wanted to get insights from this community. Specifically, I’m curious to know how many product teams or businesses here have opted *not* to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for their users due to fears of negatively impacting conversion rates or lifetime value (LTV). Am talking only about businesses and industries which can benefit some flexibility like e-commerce, online cinemas/gaming etc.), definitely not healthcare/gov or finance fields which are a subjects for multiple regulations. 

• Are aware of any cases when business avoid MFA due to concerns about onboarding friction or losing potential customers?

• Do you know if anyone measured the actual financial impact of this decision, either in terms of security risks or product/business performance?

• Did you notice any improvements in user conversion or retention by not implementing MFA, and what were the long-term costs or benefits?

* Risk going full-on cyber security for me to not be able to find a job due to my lack of experience.
* If I try and balance study between networking and cyber security then getting a job that only requires one would be a waste of another.
* Or maybe even study more broad topics such as advanced algorithms so I can leave my decision for the future.

1. For any certificate (public or private) a request has to be sent, filling a form with all the details about the certificate.
2. After approvals and stuff, an IT creates the certificate and sends it to the requestor vía email or even Teams chat. If they need the private key they will send it in the same way and share the password too.
3. Lastly, the person who requested the certificate is responsible for installing it wherever it's required.

I would like to ask about how you handle it in your jobs, but even without knowing that I see many flaws in here. The certificate, private key and password are transmitted on an insecure channel. What's crazy is that they claim they are not responsible for installing it because they don't always know how to (yeah, mind boggling).

Stick with penetration testing and keep applying along with preparing for certifications?

Shift to development and start learning from scratch, even though I don’t feel connected to it?

Take a temporary call center job to manage expenses while figuring things out?

— A frustrated job-seeker trying to figure things out 🙃",  m jobless and stuck need advice on career direction   m and i ve been trying really hard to break into the cybersecurity penetration testing field but it hasn t been going well. i either get rejected or never hear back from companies. i feel stuck and unsure about what to do next. i ve thought about shifting to development but i honestly don t know much about it and don t feel too confident starting from scratch. the main reason i want a job in penetration testing is because it s where my passion lies. another important factor is that i d like to work in my hometown the salaries may be lower here but i can manage expenses more easily and save up for certifications to grow in my field. i also considered taking up a call center job just to cover expenses but i m unsure if that s the right move since it might take time away from studying and applications. what do you think i should do stick with penetration testing and keep applying along with preparing for certifications shift to development and start learning from scratch even though i don t feel connected to it take a temporary call center job to manage expenses while figuring things out any advice would mean a lot to me right now. i m feeling quite lost and i d really appreciate some guidance. thanks for reading and for any help you can give. a frustrated job seeker trying to figure things out,1,2,1397,1368,2024,10,Sunday,18,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1g865jq/23m_jobless_and_stuck_need_advice_on_career/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1g865jq/23m_jobless_and_stuck_need_advice_on_career/,1,0.5135946310789001,0.5135946310789001,SVM (Linear)

This post is for you to share what you love and what you don’t about working in cybersecurity. I’ll start by giving you my perspective from the world of software development.

I’ve been working as a software developer for 3 years now, and after going through a tough consultancy job, I’m now at a good company where the work is pretty chill, and the salaries are decent. However, despite these advantages, I’m starting to feel increasingly bored. What frustrates me the most is the feeling that projects never end. No matter what I accomplish in a day, there’s always something left to do, and the next day, I have to pick up right where I left off. This creates a sense of “dread” because I know I’ll be facing the same issue tomorrow, and when I solve it, the cycle repeats. There’s never a day where I feel mentally clear and satisfied because everything’s wrapped up. That lack of closure makes the days feel endless.

On the flip side, there are good things too. The satisfaction of completing a project when everything goes well is an emotional high. But over time, even that doesn’t seem like enough for me anymore.

1gaj0h5,cybersecurity,Cyber_Coach,2024-10-23 19:26:44,1729711604,Non-Technical Cybersecurity Roles You Probably Didn’t Know About? Check it out...,"Hi 👋 

So, I’ve been talking to lot of my friends in the industry lately about cybersecurity careers, and it seems like most folks still think you need to be some kind of tech wizard to make it in the field. But honestly, there’s a ton of non-technical roles in cybersecurity that people don’t even know exist!

If you’re like me and love the idea of working in cyber without having to write code all day, here are some roles you might want to check out:

1. Cybersecurity Policy Analyst

This one’s perfect if you’re a bit of a research nerd (no shame in that!). These analysts figure out how companies can stay on the right side of security laws and regulations. You’re basically the person making sure everything runs smoothly from a policy perspective. Not a line of code in sight.


2. GRC Specialist (Governance, Risk & Compliance)

I know, the title sounds fancy, but at the heart of it, you’re just making sure a company’s security practices make sense for the business. No hardcore tech involved here—just helping companies avoid fines and risks. It’s a sweet spot if you’re into risk management but don’t want to get into the tech weeds.


3. Security Awareness Specialist

This one is cool if you’re into teaching. The job is to help “normal” people (a.k.a non-techies) understand why they need to care about security. You’d be creating training programs, sending out tips, and basically being the go-to person to make sure the human side of the business stays safe.


4. Data Protection Officer (DPO)

I can’t stress enough how much privacy and data protection are a big deal these days (thanks, GDPR). As a DPO, you’d help companies handle personal data the right way. You’re the person making sure they don’t get into trouble with privacy laws. If you’ve got a legal mind but aren’t into the tech side, this is your role.


5. Cybersecurity Auditor

OK, this one’s for the detail-oriented folks out there. You’d be the person checking that a company’s cybersecurity processes are up to scratch. It’s a bit like an investigator role, but instead of code, you’re diving into their policies and procedures. Not technical, but you’ve got to be sharp and thorough.


6. Cybersecurity Project Manager

You know how some people are just really good at organizing chaos? That’s what a project manager does. You’ll be managing security projects—making sure they stay on budget and schedule. No coding required, just solid project management skills.


7. Incident Response Coordinator

Imagine there’s a security breach. Everyone’s freaking out, but you’re the one keeping things calm. You’re not fixing the breach (that’s for the tech folks), but you’re coordinating the response—making sure all the right people are working together to resolve the issue.


8. Cybersecurity Recruiter

Here’s a fun one—finding talent. As a recruiter, you help companies hire cybersecurity professionals. It’s a great role if you’re good with people and want to stay in the industry without getting technical. Plus, you get to learn about all the different cyber roles along the way.


The best part about all these roles? You don’t need to be a tech genius to land them. If you’re organized, good with people skills, there’s a place for you in cybersecurity.

Have any of these caught your eye? What do you think—did I miss any other cool non-technical roles in cybersecurity? Let me know in the comments!

I recently graduated college (B.S.

Got a part time job but still have a lot of free time. I'm really interested in cyber but don't know the exact direction I want to specialize in for my long term career. I got my Sec+ and started working on my CCNA, but how would you recommend I spend my extended free time exploring the world of cyber, learning more, and maybe deciding a direction to take my career towards. 

I'm potentially interested in incident response cause it sounds exciting, pen testing sounds like it would have interesting problem solving, and network security / security architect (I think networks are really cool)

^^^ Obviously long term goals I know I'll have to pay my dues and get experience just want to learn more!

I’ve earned my Master’s in Cybersecurity and have worked for two years as an Information Security Engineer I (I was very fortunate to have gotten this entry role). I did mostly IAM work in Microsoft Azure Active Directory, or Entra ID now.

During my time there I’ve earned my CompTIA Security+ and the AZ900: Azure Fundamentals certifications. I was going to take a SANs Institute course on engineering before I lost my job.

I was laid off in February of this year, among others chosen, and in August, I found a new job. But this job is not in cyber security; it’s for IT Support. Granted, thank goodness, I’m still working in Azure, and the pay is great, but I’m very nervous about how this looks from the perspective of recruiters. 

I’m worried that I’ll be throwing my degree in the trash if I work here for too long. With how competitive the market is, the limited openings for my experience level, and me moving out soon, I don’t know how long I’m going to be working here.

I hope this doesn’t sound silly, because I keep overthinking this and it’s driving me crazy. I’ve read that cybersecurity specialists start off in IT support before breaking into the field, but having broken into the field after getting my degree, I can’t help but feel ashamed of myself. I couldn’t get another position in cyber security and it was a huge blow to my confidence. I’m unsure if this is normal, or if I’m in a good or bad place right now in my career.

So I just took a federal job as an ISSM and I had a bad feeling since day one. Let me lay the situation out for you. My previous job was in the private sector at a large defense contractor where I was an ISSE. I loved my job and I loved the company, but with any private company you have its cons. My reason for leaving was simply because it was a federal job, which offered job security, better benefits, and ability to have a pension.

While all of those points are awesome, does it matter if you hate the job? I am a highly technical person and I enjoy being in the systems and working, which is what my last job was. This new one is a compliance role, which is just a bunch of paperwork and pushing policies on programs that I support. On day one my manager was complaining all day, saying how this work sucks, the people suck, and how she cant wait until she is done with it and or retires. The pay is comparable as they matched my pay so that isn't one of my concerns.

* Federal Job:
   * Pros:
      * Better benefits
      * Job Security
      * Ability to invest into a pension
      * Every other Friday off, and ability to telecommute 50%
   * Cons:
      * I hate the work, I don't feel like I would be proficient in it and I have no interest in it.
      * The people do not seem excited or motivated to be there
      * My manager told me she hopes I do good so I can help pick up the slack of others
      * Pay as you progress in your career isnt as good as in the private sector.
* Previous Job:
   * Pros:
      * I enjoyed the work and got every Friday off
      * The people were excited to be there and wanted to work
      * Fully Remote and can live anywhere in the US
      * Wasn't super stressful like I know the Federal job will be
   * Cons:
      * Potential layoffs/restructuring as you have with any private company
      * Health benefits aren't nearly as good, but they offer an amazing 401k and HSA program

I need advice because in my head, going back is the move. But I know I should give this new role some time for the new job blues to pass, but if I do that, my old position is gone within 2 weeks. I am at a loss and have never been this stressed over a job before, and I half feel stupid for feeling this way. Any advice is good advice here.","I am stressing over new ISSM role - Previously ISSE

I HATE being an intern. Don’t get me wrong, I’m beyond grateful to even have a position in today’s job market, but the title feels like a punch in the face considering the effort I’m putting in. I’ve worked hard, get regular praise from colleagues for my work, and they genuinely value what I bring to the team. But somehow, it feels like I'm playing the ""intern"" game wrong.

There’s not much expected of you as an intern. They say you’re mostly there to learn, but how can I stand around and just learn all day? Well, obviously no sane person in my field would do that. I didn’t just shadow. I took on tasks, tackled incident response, got brought into projects, and became skilled at so many different technologies.

After six months, I felt ready for a full-time position. I was balancing school, getting certifications, and putting in real work every day to drive and make change. Of course, this is not up to me to decide when I’ll get an offer.

My company acknowledged my interest in going full-time, yet gave me the “after you graduate” talk. Due to “legal” and “tax” reasons, they said I had to stay an intern until I finish my degree in May 2025. My only thought was - *are you serious?* But really? Shouldn’t I decide how much I can handle as a student?

  
I suspect there's more to the story -  probably about budgets, but the official explanation feels like another punch in the face.

Then there’s school. My experience on the job has taught me more about cybersecurity in 14 months than my degree has in almost four years. 

The irony is that many of my colleagues don’t even have degrees in cyber. They came from different fields, took a cert or two, and got the job. Yet here I am, balancing school, getting certifications, and building real work experience—only to be told I still need the piece of paper before I can move forward.

Anyone else been in this position? How do you view the “intern” title in a positive light? And what’s the right work ethic for an intern? For me, I keep feeling like I need to match full-timers. I feel I have so much value to provide, but providing that value as an intern doesn't feel right.

*And yes, I am applying to other places, and I will continue to do so...*

1gduly2,cybersecurity,EnthusiasmWorried496,2024-10-28 05:15:20,1730092520,Burnout rant,"I've been studying all things IT/cyber for over a decade now. And not just amateurishly clicking around forums and doing a few boxes. I mean utterly pathologically and obsessively researching; building systems and networks, breaking into them, patching them, re-writing them; trying to cram as many years of experience as possible in as little time as possible. Over and over again, a never ending cycle of deep-dives and retracting back to the basics to make sure my foundations were solid, and back to more deep-dives.

Basic networking, linux/windows sysadmin skills (i.e package management, scripting, Infra-as-code, etc), ICS/SCADA, radio manipulation, embedded systems, automotive security, malware dev, Appsec, DevOps, DFIR, GRC, and so on. I'd pick a certification and read every study guide I could find online for it, knowing damn well I'd never be able to pay for it. I'd implement the concepts in a home lab to solidify everything I've learned.

And after a decade of learning, meanwhile applying for jobs and rewriting my resume over and over again... I've virtually gotten nowhere. I've worked for two different start-up companies that dissolved due to marketing failures, and the one established company i worked for (an MSP) had to let me go after a few months because they lost a big client. Ever since that one MSP let me go (which I'll re-iterate, was through no fault of my own), I've been stuck working in the food industry, factories and gas stations.

The worst part of it all, is that my obsession compelled me to at least try getting into the same buildings as the people who had the jobs that I wanted, which only led me to look through a proverbial glass ceiling, wishing I could be on top. An example is working at a food place on Fort Meade. I got to meet and talk to cybersecurity professionals all the time, if only in passing. For 2-3 minutes while they would wait for an order, I'd get to listen to them about what they do (albeit in a filtered way; clearances on the line and all). But at the end of the day, while I waited for the bus to go back home, all I could think is I would never get there. But I kept on pushing through anyways... for years even after that.

I worked at a gas station in Baltimore, where I also got to meet DB admins and SOC analysts as well... again, only in passing. Job after job, I'd find myself talking with highly skilled and intelligent professionals that I admire, only to feel a paradoxical rising resentment as time passed. I worked so fucking hard to be where they are, only to be the cashier that gave them their lunch and cigarettes.

As far as I know, no resume has ever gotten past an ATS and into a real person's inbox, and if it did, it was probably for a ghost job.

I'm just done, man. Pretty sure I'm just going to pivot to a career that plays to my other strengths like engineering, neuroscience or chemistry. Those student loans are gonna be real easy on my bank account. /s","Burnout rant

I mean utterly pathologically and obsessively researching; building systems and networks, breaking into them, patching them, re-writing them; trying to cram as many years of experience as possible in as little time as possible. Over and over again, a never ending cycle of deep-dives and retracting back to the basics to make sure my foundations were solid, and back to more deep-dives.

Basic networking, linux/windows sysadmin skills (i.e package management, scripting, Infra-as-code, etc), ICS/SCADA, radio manipulation, embedded systems, automotive security, malware dev, Appsec, DevOps, DFIR, GRC, and so on. I'd pick a certification and read every study guide I could find online for it, knowing damn well I'd never be able to pay for it. I'd implement the concepts in a home lab to solidify everything I've learned.

And after a decade of learning, meanwhile applying for jobs and rewriting my resume over and over again... I've virtually gotten nowhere. I've worked for two different start-up companies that dissolved due to marketing failures, and the one established company i worked for (an MSP) had to let me go after a few months because they lost a big client. Ever since that one MSP let me go (which I'll re-iterate, was through no fault of my own), I've been stuck working in the food industry, factories and gas stations.

The worst part of it all, is that my obsession compelled me to at least try getting into the same buildings as the people who had the jobs that I wanted, which only led me to look through a proverbial glass ceiling, wishing I could be on top. An example is working at a food place on Fort Meade. I got to meet and talk to cybersecurity professionals all the time, if only in passing. For 2-3 minutes while they would wait for an order, I'd get to listen to them about what they do (albeit in a filtered way; clearances on the line and all). But at the end of the day, while I waited for the bus to go back home, all I could think is I would never get there. But I kept on pushing through anyways... for years even after that.

I worked at a gas station in Baltimore, where I also got to meet DB admins and SOC analysts as well... again, only in passing. Job after job, I'd find myself talking with highly skilled and intelligent professionals that I admire, only to feel a paradoxical rising resentment as time passed. I worked so fucking hard to be where they are, only to be the cashier that gave them their lunch and cigarettes.

As far as I know, no resume has ever gotten past an ATS and into a real person's inbox, and if it did, it was probably for a ghost job.

I'm looking for some career and industry insights.

I'm currently at a cross road - I've been working as a pentester for 4 years. Ive learned a lot but I can feel myself mentally checking out - the work is getting repetitive and I've hit the skills ceiling!

Recently I got into threat modelling, devsecops, and risk management interests me. It suits my natural skillset too - I really enjoy working with people towards a long term strategic goal. I don't see myself specialising any further in pentesting, and don't really enjoy being so technical anymore.

I've got an offer for security architecture in a huge consultancy. However they're pretty well known for burnout (you can probably take a few guesses). The salary change is +15% but I'd be working A LOT more. 

At this point I'm pretty much working half days in pentesting, it is that easy for me, so I'm wondering if the salary would be worth it.

It's also 2 days in the office compared to me being fully remote at the moment! 

I do feel my earning potential would increase in this role, and I would get exposure to so many other areas of security which interest me. I see it as a stop gap to other interesting jobs. However I'm adverse to taking a risk in this job market...

I suppose it's a question of comfort and mediocrity vs something exciting but potentially higher risk and stress. 

I'm 27 years old in the UK if that makes it relevant!

Bachelors of Engineering (Information Tech) from a tier-3 college (very bad college from India)  - Learnt fundamentals of computer science such (Operating Systems, Computer networking (basic- like I know what OSI layer is, and what is DNS and how it works but don't know things in very dept), DSA (Arrays, Strings, Recursion, LL, basic algo's), Intro to cyber security (just theoretical knowledge - ex - RSA), etc)    -- ---   I am planning to do Masters and not f\*ck up once again, so, I want to build decent skills and get some experience before doing Masters from a good college.

2. Started coding quite late in my bachelors, didn't had any hands on experience with any project (because of tutorial hell I waste lot of time, I thought I am learning things but I was doing ""monkey see monkey do"") - here my primary goal was to learn software development in terms of (web) - but I found that I suck at frontend, so now I want to become decent at backend and thereby master in security aspect of it (basically web security).

**So, I want help and guidance from all of you, because I am feeling kind of lost, I am job less due to my poor skills, but I want to learn stuff in detail, I love to go in detail (but as we know, there are so many subs, so how to study?).**

I want suggestions from u all regarding my day to day approach to build skills and decent knowledge base in IT so that I land a job.

  
**My schedule looks like this :)**

*5:30 am to 6:30 am - Light to medium workout and then bathing*

*6:30 am to 12:30 pm - Web Development (still learning about web, building products and than understanding security aspect of it. Like writing secure code, doing testing for any vulnerabilities, testing for sql injections, etc)   ----- Want suggestions on how to learn while building software*

  
*12:30 - 1:30pm - break (Lunch and giving time to absorb that info and skills I got in those hours)*

*1:30pm to 3:30pm - DSA (understanding more complex topics so that I become a decent security engineer or in general a decent IT engineer) - I am planning to make myself good at it by solving Leetcode for the next 7-8 months  consistently and then just doing daily one question for revision*

*4 pm to 6pm - Computer Networking (for CCNA) - Apparently IT engineers need knowledge of this subject, so I think CCNA would be a create exam to make me good at networking - may be* ***6-7 months*** *for this too.* 

*6pm to 8pm - Just applying for jobs, cold mailing, networking*

On weekends, I will not cultivate new skills and knowledge rather create blogs or short videos explaining about my project, computer networking so I will recall all the information and also make myself visible to outer world.

At the end of the day, my main intention is to get a full time job, I have not got any good internship in my Bachelors so If I got one, I will just count it has my project and rest of the time will be same. 

Please help me with my approach to learn things, I am scared/tired of getting it all wrong.

Thank You :)","Want suggestions for my daily approach to learn Computer science to get a job

I have just finished my first year at uni studying a bachelor of Cyber Security, and I realized that I haven’t really learned any applicable skills.

I thought this might be because it’s only my first year and more of an introduction, but as I reviewed the course structure, I noticed that we only ever get introductions to actual skills without really developing them to the level an employer would require.

So, I went on job sites to see what they were looking for, and almost all positions ask for certifications, with very few asking for a degree. This made me start questioning what my path should be for next year.

The options I have come up with so far are:

1.	Finish the degree and, hopefully, have enough knowledge to get an entry-level role and build from there.

2.	Leave uni to pursue certifications and try to build from there.

3.	Take a break from uni—maybe for a semester—and do a certificate that can help me land a part-time role while I return to studying.

4.	Try to do both university and certifications simultaneously (though this may be challenging since I also work part-time).

Please let me know if there are more options I haven’t thought of😊

I appreciate any guidance. ","Certifications VS University

I have a bachelors degree in Information Technology with a concentration in Cyber Security, and I have the A+, Net+, Sec+, Server+, CYSA+, and AWS Cloud Essentials.

  
I want to go back into Cyber Security, but I don't know where to go. I would like to get another certification, I'm thinking something in GRC and more security management then an on-hands security professional. I'm torn between the CISA/CISM/CISSP, and don't know which one to go for next. I don't have enough exp in CISSP to be anything more than an Associate, so I'm not sure if it would even be worth taking that one yet. I'm also wondering if I should stick with on-hands security, and go down the path of taking the CEH or the CASP+.

  
I feel like up until now things were straightforward in terms of certs, but after I got the CYSA, I've felt aimless and like I don't know what my next step should be. To top things off, I'm working for a university right now and they offer tuition reimbursement, so I have the opportunity to get a masters degree in Cyber Security Policy and Risk Management.

I'm wondering if there is any value at this point in going for a basic degree and following a certification path, and if so what people suggestions were.

Long version:  
In the year 2002 I made the mistake of telling a recruiter at a event that I knew both Web Design and Assembly coding, and ended up getting sucked into the world of Cyber Security via experience but was always too busy to get certification or relevant degrees. Most of my initial coding education was from growing up with a NASA programmer for a parent, and the rest was just picked up over time on the various jobs and companies I bounced between.

Now I find myself as a Cybersecurity Researcher in title, but professionally where I feel like I either have to move into management in some other company or I need to start moving from 'occasionally reverse engineering and analyzing patches' to writing papers and making a name for myself, which feels a lot harder for me as I generally have played it low key over the past two decades and just did my job and got shit done.

I feel like without the Degrees and the like, I don't have the standing to write papers,   
and without Certs I basically am walking into new interviews going 'Trust me bro,  I got this.'

Am I overthinking this, or would it be worth the investment in either or both?  
And honestly do people have any suggestions for either one that might work with someone who is older and already in the field.","What to do when your a Senior Researcher for a Cyber Security company, and you realize that you don't have any certs or degrees?

1gpj07y,cybersecurity,shashank__b,2024-11-12 11:54:45,1731412485,Seeking Career Advice for Transition into Security Operations (SOC/Blue Teaming),"I wanted to reach out for some advice regarding my career, both in terms of the process I'm following and the emotional challenges I'm facing.

**Quick Background**:

* **Experience**: Nearly 5 years in SAP Security (4.5 years) and GRC Security (6 months).
* **Current Situation**: I’ve been laid off from my last two roles due to organizational impacts. This experience has led me to realise that I want to transition into Security Operations and Blue Teaming, and build my career in that domain.
* **Certifications**: I currently hold CISSP, CCSP, and Python certifications, but I've noticed that these don’t seem to carry the weight I expected, especially here in India.

**Current Skillsets**:

* Familiar with Splunk SIEM and proficient in Python scripting.
* Decent understanding of Threat Assessments, MITRE ATT&CK framework, and static analysis, Network security but lack hands-on experience.

**Current Efforts**:

* **Job Hunting**: Actively applying for roles in both GRC and SOC since September, with plans to expand to SAP Security positions if there’s no progress by December.
* **Skills Development**: Working through TryHackMe modules and learning paths to build foundational SOC skills.
* **Daily Routine**: Applying to 5-6 jobs daily (9-5), playing badminton for an hour, and dedicating 1-2 hours each night to TryHackMe.

**Challenges and Reflections**:

* **Career Switch Hurdles**: It feels difficult to switch domains after 5 years in SAP/GRC Security, but part of me feels it’s not too late at 27.
* **Interview Challenges**: I've faced expectations around incident response experience. In one interview, I tried to build a story around phishing incidents but struggled when asked about EDR, particularly because I lack experience with tools like Microsoft Defender. I’m also unsure how to gain hands-on experience with such tools.
* **HR mindset:** It seems that some recruiters may still associate layoffs with poor performance, which can impact perceptions. How can I effectively address this gap beyond highlighting my commitment to upskilling during this period? Are there additional ways to convey that layoffs were not performance-related?
* **Interview Outcomes**: In the past 2 months, I’ve had 8 interviews but didn’t progress beyond the first round in any. Feedback indicated I might be overqualified in some cases.
* **Overwhelmed with TryHackMe**: I’m wondering if I should expand to platforms like LetsDefend or Hack The Box. If so, could you recommend specific modules?

**Questions**:

1. **Is it realistic to switch from GRC/SAP Security to SOC?** Or am I better off returning to SAP Security/GRC and building a career there?
2. **Improving Efficiency**: What strategies can I use to streamline my job hunting and resume modifying process?
3. **Additional Resources**: Would investing in LetsDefend or HTB help me progress, and if so, which modules would you recommend?

I would appreciate any guidance or resources you can suggest. This career shift means a lot to me, and I’m eager to hear your insights on making this transition successful.

In my current role as a security engineer, i'm in an exciting but also somewhat stressful position of being responsible for security testing and QA for our product and a handful of clients (pentesting). 

Working for a cyber security startup, I really like the role, essentially helping to build products for security engineers whilst getting to deliver security testing and build our internal security programme is a treasure trove in terms of experience, but I'm somewhat torn between which path I want to focus on.

While I love security and my skillset has been very much focused around security testing and engineering up until recently, I also love helping to deliver QA, feedback to the product team and essentially have a hand in the product development process. 

As we scale and grow these two functions will likely become much more unwieldy and as such I'm sort of at a cross roads: Security Engineering or Product QA. 

I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience in roles they've held, particularly at smaller or startup security companies building products.

In an ideal world, creating a role which combined QA and Security engineering sounds great but I'm not sure it scales and could easily lead to burnout, although I'd love to hear some other thoughts on this!

1gvq5mq,cybersecurity,Jaad5,2024-11-20 14:01:36,1732111296,Could you help to fix my knowledge gap?,"Hello,

I would like to hear your opinion or guidance on the following:

I have over 10 years of experience in IT audit, but recently I've started to feel quite tired and burned out. This has led me to explore a potential career change, transitioning into a second line of defense role where I can contribute to the strategic side of risk mitigation.

The challenge I'm facing is that my experience in IT audit has primarily focused on governance, compliance with IT policies, and related areas. While I have a solid foundational understanding of cybersecurity and information security, I’ve noticed some gaps in my technical knowledge. When things get particularly technical, I sometimes feel that I can’t provide as much value as I would like—something that could become an issue if I were to assume a role like IT Security Officer.

My question is: Are there any certifications or training courses you would recommend to help me bridge these gaps?

Currently, I’m considering Security+ (Sec+) and Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP), leaning towards SSCP as my preferred choice.

For context, my educational background includes the CISA, CISM, and CC certifications, a bachelor's degree in systems engineering, but no master’s degree.

Thank you in advance for your guidance!

Edit: many thanks for the comments to all of you.","Could you help to fix my knowledge gap?

1gwhb6c,cybersecurity,NeuralNotwerk,2024-11-21 14:17:43,1732198663,Constantly Learning Security or Constantly Learning Tech?,"I've seen some hate posts lately related to constantly having to study/learn security outside of work. I believe this is framed incorrectly. I don't think we need to constantly learn security. I think we need to constantly learn the tech we plan to apply core security concepts to.

This field simply requires a drive to continue learning and enough self directed learning skills to make digesting the influx of new tech easy. The core concepts of security stay exactly the same. The technology you apply them to changes by the minute. I think a lot of people conflate the passion for learning with the passion for security itself, admittedly I even make this same mistake regularly when mentoring, I say security instead of learning. Passion for both is absolutely great if that's your thing, but the passion for learning tech or what ever you want to apply security to should be enough.

There's also people with differing work experiences and differing intelligence levels. If your employer gives you time for continued learning and experimentation on the clock (which it absolutely should, if not, find another employer) - you don't have to appear as passionate about learning new tech outside of your working hours. If your employer is short sighted and doesn't provide adequate time/space/money for education, you are going to need to invest your own time outside of work in the pursuit of learning new tech and work towards finding a new employer. Even if your employer provides time for you to learn, but you are not someone that is capable of really handling self directed learning, you are going to need to appear passionate about tech outside of your job.

Are there employers where you can sit on arse and do almost no personal development without having to worry about it after hours? Yes, there absolutely are. These are not typically highly paid. You are also stuck should you have a desire to move or if the company shuts down. If you are forced into finding a new job after some time employed at a place that doesn't change, your skills and knowledge on current tech would have become so irrelevant that you are now out of a job and job searching while having to try to make your resume and interview skills relevant again - you've effectively become a new hire or fresh grad again.

There's another caveat to this. A lot of recent education and certification programs that try to get people into the industry quickly teach ""security"" (compliance) instead of the foundations that security can be applied to nearly anything. Most people who think security, not tech in general, are a constant slog are probably not well prepared to do security. People often misidentify security as compliance, checklists, antivirus, top 10s, and patching. If you've memorized ""security"" and you require someone else to provide you a checklist or some compliance framework to get things done, it probably really does appear like security is a grind game where your job is to memorize the latest framework and checklist. I'm literally cringing thinking about this closed view of what security is - and it doesn't even work to improve legitimate and functional security.

You can effectively abstract all of security to the CIA triangle. The problem is most people that don't seem to understand this aren't technical enough to make that abstraction. They don't want to be technical. For them, the constant drudgery of learning the latest security topic (not tech in general) really probably is miserable and I'd agree with them.

So what we do in security as competent security engineers and security professionals is apply basic concepts to tech we we keep up to date on. You can't secure it effectively if you don't know how it works.

What are the foundations that make you effective in security if they aren't security? OS admin, Net admin, and coding skills are what makes you competent to take on everything in security. Throw in some cloud and AI if you want to spice it up, but these are mostly abstractions on top of OS/Net/Code. If you've got OS admin, Net admin, and coding skills, there's almost nothing that is overly complicated and you can't figure out how to apply security to. The core concept of security can be had in the CIA Triangle.","Constantly Learning Security or Constantly Learning Tech?

The core concept of security can be had in the CIA Triangle.",constantly learning security or constantly learning tech i ve seen some hate posts lately related to constantly having to study learn security outside of work. i believe this is framed incorrectly. i don t think we need to constantly learn security. i think we need to constantly learn the tech we plan to apply core security concepts to. this field simply requires a drive to continue learning and enough self directed learning skills to make digesting the influx of new tech easy. the core concepts of security stay exactly the same. the technology you apply them to changes by the minute. i think a lot of people conflate the passion for learning with the passion for security itself admittedly i even make this same mistake regularly when mentoring i say security instead of learning. passion for both is absolutely great if that s your thing but the passion for learning tech or what ever you want to apply security to should be enough. there s also people with differing work experiences and differing intelligence levels. if your employer gives you time for continued learning and experimentation on the clock   you don t have to appear as passionate about learning new tech outside of your working hours. if your employer is short sighted and doesn t provide adequate time space money for education you are going to need to invest your own time outside of work in the pursuit of learning new tech and work towards finding a new employer. even if your employer provides time for you to learn but you are not someone that is capable of really handling self directed learning you are going to need to appear passionate about tech outside of your job. are there employers where you can sit on arse and do almost no personal development without having to worry about it after hours yes there absolutely are. these are not typically highly paid. you are also stuck should you have a desire to move or if the company shuts down. if you are forced into finding a new job after some time employed at a place that doesn t change your skills and knowledge on current tech would have become so irrelevant that you are now out of a job and job searching while having to try to make your resume and interview skills relevant again   you ve effectively become a new hire or fresh grad again. there s another caveat to this. a lot of recent education and certification programs that try to get people into the industry quickly teach security instead of the foundations that security can be applied to nearly anything. most people who think security not tech in general are a constant slog are probably not well prepared to do security. people often misidentify security as compliance checklists antivirus top   s and patching. if you ve memorized security and you require someone else to provide you a checklist or some compliance framework to get things done it probably really does appear like security is a grind game where your job is to memorize the latest framework and checklist. i m literally cringing thinking about this closed view of what security is   and it doesn t even work to improve legitimate and functional security. you can effectively abstract all of security to the cia triangle. the problem is most people that don t seem to understand this aren t technical enough to make that abstraction. they don t want to be technical. for them the constant drudgery of learning the latest security topic really probably is miserable and i d agree with them. so what we do in security as competent security engineers and security professionals is apply basic concepts to tech we we keep up to date on. you can t secure it effectively if you don t know how it works. what are the foundations that make you effective in security if they aren t security os admin net admin and coding skills are what makes you competent to take on everything in security. throw in some cloud and ai if you want to spice it up but these are mostly abstractions on top of os net code. if you ve got os admin net admin and coding skills there s almost nothing that is overly complicated and you can t figure out how to apply security to. the core concept of security can be had in the cia triangle.,14,9,4309,4178,2024,11,Thursday,14,/r/cybersecurity/comments/1gwhb6c/constantly_learning_security_or_constantly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1gwhb6c/constantly_learning_security_or_constantly/,1,0.5082502798847173,0.5082502798847173,SVM (Linear)

I’m looking for recommendations and opinions on which certifications or training I should pursue based on my current situation.

I currently work as an Information Security Manager in the insurance sector in Europe. I recently completed my Master’s degree in IT Security (three months ago), and I also have a few years of experience working in InfoSec alongside my studies. Now, I’m exploring certifications or training programs to further enhance my profile.

I believe I have a solid foundation in IT infrastructure and its security. I can effectively follow discussions and engage with sysadmins on security topics, but I often feel that I lack the in-depth knowledge to confidently assert my points or bring my own ideas to the table. On the other hand, I support and partially lead audits (ISO 27001) and handle regulatory requests.

  
I'm struggling to decide whether to pursue certifications focused on audit / IT-Governance / Risk management or something more technical, such as CySA+. For CISSP, I still don’t meet the required years of experience to get certified. I'd appreciate some advice on whether it's the right move for me at this stage.

I’m especially interested in security architecture and analyzing or deciding on architectural changes that make sense for an organization.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!","Looking for Certification Recommendations for an InfoSec Manager

I think I bit off more than I can chew and would rather have a security career that's more laid back and allows me to do my hobbies versus prioritizing myself over work. Anyone who's been in this situation before, any useful feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Apologies in advance to how disorganized this post may be.

I've been in IT for almost a decade. 8 of those years have been in security. Most of my experience has been in managed security services (MSS) or security operations (SecOps), or ""run"" teams. I started as an analyst and worked my way up to team lead. I recently left MSS / SecOps to switch to consulting because I wanted to build my skill set to become an architect. However, I'm slowly discovering I don't enjoy it as much as Operations. Therefore, I'm having second thoughts on becoming an architect.

There's certainly pros and cons to both consulting and operations, or build and run.

Operations was much more chill. Yes, the SecOps experience I had was actually chill because most of our clients were government organizations (kind of a con), but a lot of that is playing the waiting game. Ops folks were cool to talk with, much more chill, spoke to me like a normal person, not as condescending. The flip side is not all of them were the brightest, and the upper management / leadership conversations get way too fiesty, but luckily I never had to join them. That's above my pay grade.

Consulting is just insanely different than what I'm used to. Everything is much more fast-paced, far more chaotic, constantly pushing against scope creep, always walking on eggshells around conversations with the client, 200% disorganized meeting structures on the client side, working during lunch seems very common, manufactured positivity radiating from my company (including people who post crap on LinkedIn like their back facing the camera as they're looking into a sunset so they can post about how life has their challenges, or whatever bullshit), the list goes on. My manager has been carrying most of the weight on the project I'm currently staffed to because he is far more knowledgeable than me. I've been asking for help from others, but I'm not getting the answers I need, and I don't know enough to help my own manager. I just feel entirely helpless and useless.

Additionally, I'm currently working in the Microsoft Security workspace, specifically Defender, Sentinel, & Purview. I wish all these products were as glamorous as MSFT makes them out to be, however, all I ever run into with these solutions / tools are problems. Some of those problems could very well be on my end, and some are certainly on the MSFT backend. So I feel like I'm working on tools that don't function properly, and I'm not making a difference at all.

Now time for the brief personal part:

It's been a hectic 3 months for me. Last month, I bought my first house out of state and still haven't completely settled into it yet, which alone adds its stressful components. I haven't been able to do any of my hobbies like music production / sound design and homelab projects like I've been dying to do for years because I haven't had the space to do it. Now that I bought a house, I do have the space. However, with this consulting gig, my brain is fried, I'm often tired, I often dread the next day, and sometimes even cry about it.

Back to the last bit of security talk:

The aspects of security I'm interested in are compliance / frameworks / laws, critical infrastructure security, and Azure. Azure has its anomalies as well because it's MSFT, but I feel Azure functions better than Defender / Sentinel / Purview, but maybe I'm wrong. I just want a gig that pays well, is mostly chill, and allows me to have a life outside of work. I don't mind staying over every once in a while, but not to the point where I prioritize work over myself.

Any useful advice / feedback / recommendations / suggestions / tips are all welcome. Thank you very much in advance, have a fantastic Friday, and wonderful weekend!","Lost. What would you do in my situation?

I'm worried I'll hate what's next.

I've been in the industry over 10 years having started out as a pentest and later red team consultant. I transitioned to an R&D focused role building out SOC capabilities and incident management platforms, working closely with a large SOC team, while building tooling for a red team capability, and providing SME support for everything from incidents to red team engagements. I even worked in and around threat intel, solution engineering, and sales, it was a fantastic role. Then I left to start my own business and after completely burning out of both energy and cash, I'm looking for employment again. 

I'm extremely concerned that I haven't really found my ""thing"" yet as far as a typical career person goes, I guess I'm not one of those people but now I feel I need to be. I'm getting interviewed for roles from pentesting to security engineering management, but nothing appeals to me except the money. I'm also interviewing for a role as a high level software engineer in a company that effectively wants me to be the tech lead doing the very thing I've failed to do in my business. This one appeals to me the most albeit I've not had an offer so it could simply not be a real option.

I'm completely exhausted mentally, and I'd love to hear what people think about my concerns. Basically, I worry that I won't have adequate career progression in some of these roles, or I won't like them at all, but end up stuck because my most recent experience will make it such that I can't transition into something senior enough in a role I prefer to match my expectations (salary and influence - I love autonomy). My skillset is diverse, and I guess I've gravitated towards this sort of builder of security solutions type role without thinking about it, but now I feel like I need to see a reasonably clear path for progression into more senior / leadership roles, as my adventure into entrepreneurship has failed. This one worries me the most, as it feels like I'm really venturing into software engineering in a specific security niche, I worry this pigeon hole will be incredibly hard to get out of if I find it's a mistake. I'd like to scratch some technical and leadership itches now, but I imagine the latter will appeal to me the older I get. What are the prospects here for me? I've also thought about advisory roles but they seem so GRC focused that I'd probably be considered under qualified.

As a side note / tangent, for me the industry seems broken. So many vendors and consultancies have been consolidated through acquisitions, leaving just a few huge vendors as viable options to land a job that would appeal to me, and they're either not hiring or have extremely high expectations of candidate experience in very specific areas. Thus going internal seems like the only viable way of getting paid in a way that reflects my experience. I'm truly just shocked as to how limited the job market has become for senior roles. I know numerous industry veterans that are in a similar position of not knowing what's next, these are people with more experience than I in varied roles. The industry used to be one of opportunities, now it feels like you're left to choose between low grade vendors who can't pay decent salaries but will offer big job titles, or super vendors that only hire once a year and / or have no senior level opportunities, or ones that have incredibly high and unrealistic expectations. If you didn't get into the right role at the right company about 5 years ago, it feels like your options are significantly limited.","Help figure out the next steps for my career, also the industry seems broken

I am a beginner in the cybersecurity space as in I don’t have a bachelor degree in the field. I am currently working on getting the google cybersecurity certification on Coursera I’m on course 7/8. I do plan on getting the sec+ certification since they offer a discount for it.

Now as far as my experience goes in technology and computers I’m no stranger I’ve been using computers since I was a young kid from building them to my dad teaching me a basic hello world prompt, to making mods for games I like to play. I’ve always been very into computer viruses and how they were made and operate. Because of my fascination I followed a YouTube home lab project to make an analysis lab using a virtual box and remnux. I also have help desk experience I worked with Charter communications(spectrum) as technical support for their customers. I worked the role for about 2 1/2 before they removed their remote opportunities. I had to leave the company because the commute was 3 hours from my house. 

I’ve been applying to SOC positions since June of this year at about 5-10 applications a week. It’s now December and I haven’t gotten anything back no interviews or follow ups just the standard auto denial that comes after a few days. Is it just an over saturation of applicants or is it that I do not have the necessary experience for an entry level Soc position.

I’ve been working as a SOC analyst for the past 4 years and recently joined a Big 4 firm about 3 months ago as an L2 analyst, supporting a large client. While it’s been exciting in some ways, I’m really struggling to adapt here.

Most of my teammates are already familiar with the tools and processes since they’ve been part of this project for a while. I, on the other hand, feel like I’m constantly playing catch-up. I haven’t been given access to all the tools yet, and just when I start to get a grip on something, there’s a new tool or process thrown into the mix. It’s overwhelming, and no matter how much I try, I feel like I’m not learning or contributing as much as I should be.

In my previous role with an MSS project, my tasks were mostly ticket-based, and the client-side team handled the resolution. I wasn’t directly working for a single client or communicating with end users, which, I realize now, has made the learning curve here even steeper.

On top of it, the rotational 24/7 shifts have been tough to handle. My previous job had fixed early morning shifts, which worked well for me, but this setup is really starting to take a toll. I honestly feel so overwhelmed at times that I’m considering quitting, even though this company was once my dream place to work and the pay is great.

That said, I’ve been thinking about moving away from SOC altogether and transitioning into roles like Threat Intelligence or Threat Hunting. I feel like these fields align better with my skills and interests, but I’m not sure how to start or what the roadmap looks like. Also, most cybersecurity job postings I see on LinkedIn seem to require 24/7 availability, and I wonder if that’s just the reality of the industry or if there are better options out there.

If anyone here has moved from SOC into Threat Intel or similar roles, I’d love to hear how you did it. Any advice, guidance, or even sharing your own experience would really help me right now.","Seeking Guidance on Transitioning from SOC to Threat Intelligence

My background is in Linux system administration and DevOps. Now I am an Information Security Engineer.  
I have this question - **why da faq** do I have to literally beg people to do the work they were asked to do by their leaders? Work overloading is somewhere in the middle for the employees. 

Of course, I know this comes down to how the management thinks of security *(which I would say they like pretty much and help us in any way possible*), the mentality of the employees, and the industry, but cmon! Like, for real - do you happen to be chasing people all the damn time, constantly, to the point you are feeling like you are annoying them, but it is what it is and you gotta do your job? 

I tend to be quite helpful (*or at least nobody told me I am not*) when I discuss a security concern. I usually work with the system administrator mindset and try to explain what is the issue, how I came across it, what caused it (if possible), how to resolve it, what happens if it's not resolved, and business impact classification is provided, also. I am not the kinda guy who wants all vulnerabilities resolved. I have enough experience to understand that will never happen, nor do I want everything done in one day. I am a patient man, I know how to handle this.   
  
Employees of the company seem supportive as well, *kinda*.  The security department is a few months old and I am one of the first employees in the company I've been with the company before in the IT department so people know me. I don't want to hate the company or the position or anything, I am not a perfect person, but I am just wondering if I should switch to **DevSecOps** or **Application Security** *(I know they are different*). The thing that I like is technical work, not policies and similar GRC-related stuff. I don't do GRC now, the company uses it more for my technical knowledge and I like that.

There are a lot of meetings and lots of Excel reporting and Jira/Confluence stuff, which are not my favorite. Don't get me wrong, I like to write detailed comments, descriptions, and so on, but most of the time people don't seem to care that I try to help them with informative comments and guides.

Seeking advice because I have just received an offer from EY as a full remote senior cyber consultant in their SIEM/SOAR space.

Current job is very chill as an Engineer, <40 hour work weeks, 4-5 weeks (“unlimited”) PTO a year, and I can pretty much work on whatever I want within reason.

Recently I decided to take the plunge and finish school full time. I had always wanted to get into cybersecurity (specifically ICS/OT security) since I finished highschool. 

My advisors saw that I was interested in cyber and notified me that they would be ending their CIT Bachelors program and splitting it into a Cybersecurity Bachelors program and a ""Cloud Engineering"" program. Both are just CIT programs with networking, AWS, database management courses but with respective courses and certifications in each. IE ""Security Assessment"" or a Sec+ course ""Cybersecurity Fundamentals"". 
Not knowing better or really understanding how broad of a field ""cybersecurity"" really was, I swapped out of my computer engineering degree and into the ""cybersecurity"" program.

I found the coursework to be incredibly underwhelming for someone like me with a significant amount of experience with everything computers. The whole program just seems designed to dump students into SoC roles (We get a lot of Arctic Wolf recruiters if that says anything). Students in the program do compete in CCDC and related competitions but we dont place particularly well.

I feel like I've made a mistake but it's too late to course correct. I graduate soon and I would have to add 2 years of school to go back to a computer engineering degree.

I feel personally that I have the skillset and experience needed to get into the role that I originally opted for, I have a decent selection of certs (Sec+, CySa, PNPT, Network+, PIPA) but I really don't think having a ""BS. in Cybersecurity"" is going to even land me an interview because of the (justified) stigma around such a degree.
