1e5m6cj,"Cybersecurity: Exciting but eventually burned out?
I've seen a lot of posts and comment say about the same thing, they get into the field excited about fighting cybercrime and looking over security systems. But then after a month or a year, Burnout hits.

Cybersecurity is interesting, you get to make a real difference, and there is this cool factor to catch bad actors.

My question here, is cybersecurity a recipe for burnout, or can you keep it like it first started?
 
Tell me what might cause the burnout or overwhelming and how to build a cybersecurity career that's both fulfilling and sustainable.",0.386920005083084,1

After working nearly two years in CyberSec, I think I've started to realise this isn't the industry for me. I always feel behind, and the amount of work is sometimes unbearable.

Does anyone know of another industry that would be better suited for me? I work on the blue team side of things, but I don't feel like I've learned what I should have in the two years I've been here. There are so many security tools, vulnerabilities, and exploits; it's too overwhelming.""

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.",0.38131195306778,1

Typically burnout is due to being overworked / stressed, but also this is a form of burnout I guess… but labelled as career just in case. 

My current job is boring me to death. I work for a large financial services org, been here 4 years. My role is providing per change security advisory/architecture. The only challenges I face really is dealing with internal politics. Much of the cyber aspects of the role is cyber theatrics. 

I still do a little often in terms of up-skilling, learning and trying out things. Thankfully I have a healthy work life balance as well, I exercise, good relationship, good friends, travel etc. I just have this sense of malaise at work and development.

Trying to find a new job atm is proving a challenge. All the jobs I see look are equally or more dull, or I actually feel de-skilled in some ways so anything that’s more interesting scares me a bit. In the past I’ve been more ballsy and went for a challenge.

In short I’m in a rut. Change would do me good but it’s hard to get out the treacle. So looking to anyone else in cyber that’s worked in a large depressingly dull job, what did you do to perk yourself up and make a move?",0.370396912097931,1

Anyone ever feel they would just want a “normal job”. 

Zero disrespect to anyone that has a different job, no offence meant. 

Iv been in cybersecurity 6.5 years now have had multiple roles and generally very very happy with the line of work. 

BUT I am starting to feel I would just want a job where I can go do what I need to do and go home. The nature of the field of work is very fast paced meaning the constant upkeep in news , threats , vulnerabilities and general information sometimes gets a bit much ! 

And the constant need to up skill is a killer sometimes when you just want to work away for a while if life is super busy outside work. 

For context I got my degree in cybersecurity nearly 7 years ago. Since then I feel like it’s been nonstop and a bit of a pressure cooker since then. 

Granted maybe I need a new role with a different company that has more of a balance. 

But can’t help feel I’d love to just have a job and go home and not worry about anything in between.

I've fantasized about walking away from the industry for quite some time, but it's always just been therapy.

Hey folks   
I'm a mid senior security professional at a 2000 employee size company and with my current career trajectory - I'm seeing myself as a CISO within 2 years. 

Given the already stress environment I'm in . How do CISOs manage it?

I thought of running a personal project on ""CISO therapy"" but I want topics to talk about   
  
My way of escapism is binge watching science-fiction and travelling but I'm not sure whether this is case for most

Hello all. Thank you for your guidance thus far. At this time, I have consulted persons on linkedin and elsewhere about career advice and best resume formats. I have also started a splunk homelab and obtained my CEH cert, on top of a four degree and SEC+, as well as continuous learning through coursera and tryhackme. Even with all of that, I have only had two interviews (out of 162 job applications submitted) that went no where. I personally feel like I am running out of options, and beginning to think I have wasted my time trying to further my career. I even considered throwing money at the problem and getting paid career advice from Jon Good or Unixguy and even doing the CISSP. What should I do ?",0.319015353918076,1

Hello,

I dont know where to begin, Ive been working as a SOC L1 for the last 6 months and the experience has been great (to an extent) Ive met alot of great and knowledgeable people in this field and other fields, but idont know if I can tolerate the 24/7/365 shifts especially at my pay (i live in Lebanon and its suffering from a financial problem, and my pay is close to 700$)

Ive learned alot in the past 6 months and when I say alot i mean ALOT. Ive become very familiar with Azure and Investigating on there, in addition to Investigating and navigating FortiEDR, also managing Ransomware Cases and understanding how to deal in such cases (start ripping out wires and going mental) (that was a joke) in addition to conducting VAs and many more skills ofc under supervision of our TeamLeader where I asked alot of questions.

But idont know how to describe it, its like im getting overwhelmed, even when i take days off. okay i get my 2 days off to cool down but whenever i return its just hectic. there are few issues here and there but i feel like im getting drained, i cant simply quit and search for another job its so Hectic here and the pay is low. Ive tried applying abroad but every email is ""unfortunately"" and frankly nobody would visa sponsor a fresh grad with almost 1 year of experience abroad. I really love cybersecurity and I dont want to leave it but i just want a little break to relax work in an environment that is actually cyber not a mix of few things with a tad of cyber (i wish i could go into details regarding this but i cant and it hurts). is there something in cybersecurity where it isnt 24/7/365 and is also technical? or idk please give out your opinion id like to hear soemthing",0.295851200819016,1

Hey Everyone, a guy working as a senior appsec engineer at a SaaS Company from india... Let me quick you give intro about my background 

My Timeline

- Started as CTF player in 2016 
- Made into Bugbounties from 2017 
- Made enough money and quit bugbounty in 2021 to learn something new 
- In 2021, Joined a fintech company based in pune as a Senior Analyst and started managing bugbounty management.. Like onboarding applications, Budget allocation kind of program management role 
- Unfortunately it didn't last long... Due to family problem where I was in the situation I need to quit because I need to travel around 2,000 kms every week to take care of my parents as I was leaving away from them
- Immediately and blindly joined this SaaS company based in Chennai... Now part of AppSec team 


Problems that I'm facing 

- After joining the SaaS Company, again started in VAPT role... Nowadays I literally hate this alot especially doing the same stuff again and again...I really loved doing job in fintech Company because of new role and new responsibilities 
- After joining the SaaS Company, analysed their security posture gave them ideas on improving the security posture...Because the posture is really bad and Made a presentation... Discussed for 2 hrs and at the end of meeting... They told it won't work out and improvement idea which I made it was based on SaaS security posture
- So, eventually I left the idea and Made a decision that we have a bounty program... So left the pentest on web, APIs, Mobile behind and started focusing on new things which I didn't learn or experience in the past.. Chosen cloud native security part to start out with Kubernetes and Docker pentesting...Learned it and management told to focus on the VAPT... It really sucks 


Sometimes the people talk behind my back... Which is obviously hurt my feelings and can't focus on my tasks or even learning... Kind of become monkey minded person...

Anyone else having bad luck with the job market? I recently went through an interview process through a referral and thought it went well through both stages. I asked for feedback at the end of each and the first one I received good tips and praise. For the second round I took the advice and felt I knocked it out of the park only to get a rejection email a month later. Asked for feedback to HR on why they decided to move forward with someone else, was promised a call about it the next day and got ignored when I went to follow up. I feel like I’ve been putting my heart and soul into preparing for these and lately I’ve just been striking out as opposed to how it was a couple years ago. 

I have about 4.5 years experience and have been leading IR for about 2+ years at my company. The last job I interviewed for was a TI position requiring 2 years exp which is what I want to do. I just keep striking out and I’m not sure what else to do. Any advice from you folks? 

Some part of me is leaning toward getting out altogether but I don’t want to quit this field just yet. I really want to pivot back into threat intelligence.",0.279705733060837,1
