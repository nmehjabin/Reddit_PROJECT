Hello Everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I am a master's student currently working on my thesis.

My research focuses on understanding the impact of different work environments (traditional office, work-from-home, and hybrid models) on burnout among IT professionals. My goal for this study is to better understand how various work arrangements affect stress levels, job satisfaction, and overall wellbeing in the IT industry.

Your participation is completely voluntary, and all your responses will be kept confidential. The survey will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. No compensation will be provided for participation.

### Opening Statement

In argument theory, there's a concept of a false dichotomy. Within a false dichotomy, we assess that things can be good or bad. It's time to leave or stay. I'm burned out or I'm passionate. It's a natural human decision tree method, which makes decisions binary and - in some cases- that's easier than having options. (Un)fortunately, life is rarely so binary - despite our careers literally being about ones and zeroes.

I've been a community member here for a while across different accounts. On a given day, you'll see at least one post about ""HoW dO I bEcOmE a L33T H@xor wItHOuT DoInG mY oWn ReSeArCh?"" and it's balanced out with ""How do I get out?"". If it weren't so frequent that we see the same two posts day in and day out, it would be funny.

The goal of this post is to provide you options to assess what's in the decimal points between 1 and 0, and hopefully some of the tricks and strategies will help you.
  
### Tricks to be discussed:

- Challenge the status quo
- Diversify your value streams
- Intra-preneurship [Not a typo]

### Why Me?

Before I start, I want to give my obligitory ""why does my opinion matter?"". Brutally honest - it doesn't. This is just some more text in the world that's repeating great things others have said before. Ego inflating - I've launched and sold a successful security start up, worked for fortune 5 companies, and I'm an ex-lifeguard at the YMCA.

### Disclaimers

I'm not a mental health professional and the advice I'm giving should be taking with that in mind. There are mental health challenges, temporary or chronic, that may be associated with thoughts of being trapped into a situation. This advice is intended to be taken broadly and with a slab of salt.

### Challenge the Status Quo

I have yet to be in a single business where the processes were perfect, everything worked like a well oiled machine, and it was sunshine and rainbows. If you have a workplace like this, and you're reading this article, kindly go climb a tree. This is for the rest of us who live on earth.

With the status quo often comes things like routine, manual tasks that offer minimal value. There are standing meetings that don't make sense. There are boundaries that you aren't allowed to cross, even though the fix is right in plain sight. It can entrap you into a box of function that feels self defeating in many ways. On the other hand...

The status quo may come with such disorganized chaos that nothing is getting done. Everyone complains about issues all the time, but nothing is getting done about any of them. The backlog (if there even is one) is so long and out of date that the thought of prioritizing and executing it requires mental stamina that only tibetan monks have attained. It's crazy out there.

In either situation, I find that a lot of people stuck in the status quo feel helpless to change things and don't feel like they have options. Depending on the company, that may be true, but there are some things to try before giving up.

In any situations where you are challenging the status quo, it needs to be done with respect for why the tape (or chaos) is there. The best way to justify doing what you see as important is to understand the biggest pain points in the business and tackling them. This means talking with your management and other stake holders to see what's bothering them.

Once you have a good sense of the boundaries and challenges that exist, you can start to put together a strategy for dealing with them. Most boundaries are there for good reasons, but sometimes they need to be adjusted. This is where a proof of concept comes into play. Often times when I have an idea for a change, the most effetive way to get support is to put something in a decision maker's hand that shows the change. This could be a script, or a diagram, or a spreadsheet; it just needs to show the value you're bringing.

#### An anecdote --

Once upon a time, I worked at a large utility company and I'm pretty sure the entire thing was built with red tape. I've never spent more time or energy on documentation and process than I did at that organization, so it definitely fell into the first status quo definiton. While my time there was cut short by a certain pandemic, I was quite successful in my role ther and still have many good relationships from the role.

What helped me succeed in the role was doing what I knew needed to be done rather than waiting for a process to complete. The project needed a script built and the devs were busy? I wrote one. We needed to parse and analyze 16GB of logs a day and I had a 6th gen U processor to do it with? Time to learn rust. We needed a business primer on MFA methods? I crafted one. We needed a financial projection for different solutions? I built it.

Instead of being constrained to what my job title was, I actively filled gaps and drove success. I prioritized the biggest pain points and allowed the noisy red tape to whine in the background unless it really was urgent. Along the way, I built the relationships with key people in the organization who also wanted change but needed help showing the path forward.

On the flipside, I had a colleague who was such a rule follower, he genuinely struggled in his role. On top of that, his manager was quite strict in his persuit of delivery. For months I watched the colleague flail about, until one day I snapped at him. 

I pointed out that he wasn't likely going to be perfect at attaining all the written expectations for his role given the amount of tape. In that situation, demonstrating value by completing work was more important than being perfect at following the red lines. When he let go of trying to do everything by the book, and focus on getting things done he felt more empowered to do his job and was actually recognized for it. The manager who had been overbearing came to be trusting instead.

### Diversify your value streams

Originally, I had this section titled for income streams, but I realize that was a single minded approach. In reality, a lot of the times we feel stuck because we don't have other engagements in our lives. Those could be side hustles, hobbies, or community work but they should all be something that keeps you engaged in something else. This (then) excludes mindless activities that lead to less fulfillment, such as watching TV.

Now, I'm not attacking watching TV. There's a time and place for sitting in front of the screen and getting lost in a story or catching up on the news. However, activities like this or doom scrolling have been demonstrated to do little for our motivation and sense of fulfillment. In fact, at too much exposure they can demotivate and defalte our sense of self.

For me, I have found the freelancing keeps me well engaged. I get to learn and solve different problems, often for temporary clients so nothing to long or boring after a period of time. I've also donated a lot of time to local non-profits to support their IT and provide teaching to those who want to get into the field. All these activities are outside of my work hours and keep me engaged by forcing my focus onto other activities for a while. 

Note on the excuse of having families: I have one. Four kids, a disabled wife, and all the extras that brings. As the single income earner for the family, I do a lot to keep them taken care of, but I still make time to play Minecraft with the kids, build legos, build camp fires, etc. with them. Most of my side work is done early morning or after the kids go to bed.

### Intra-preneurship

Now, some of you don't want to or aren't allowed (by your employment agreement) to seek externaml work. In any case, I highly recommend at looking in your business and seeing if there are opportunities for you to take on responsibilities that align with your career goals and business need. With the exception of large enterprises (and even they have these gaps), there's more hats to be worn than people to fill them. Any start up people know this too well.

In the small-medium business category, if you really need a change of pace but like the people you're with, speak up. Create a business case for the change and demonstrate how you could make a difference in that area. You may find that you're able to build your own brand within the organization as the person who brings positive change. With the reputational growth comes increased trust and opportunity to change the status quo, drive value, and make a fulfilling career of your own chosing within the organizatoin construct. 

If you want to learn more about this specific topic, David Bet Patrick wrote a great book ""5 Steps Ahead"" that covers this and more. I recommend it.

### In Closing

These are just three techniques for fighting your sense of being trapped or stuck. Each of them allows you to create a decimal point between ""should I stay or go"" leading to options like:

- 0.0: Leave
- 0.2: Attempt Intraprenuership
- 0.5: Challenge the status quo
- 0.8: Diversify Value Steams
- 1.0: Stay

Good luck out there, and remember that jobs are a major factor in life and they aren't going to make you personally fulfilled 100% of the time. It's not any company's job to make you happy as an employee; and HR is there to make sure you're productive. This is all as it should be. Your fulfillment and happiness is largely depenent on your ability to control your response to situations. These strategies will help, and there are many others to choose from as well.",0.281245231628417,0

I’m beyond burnt out

I’m not really sure what I hope to achieve by posting this, perhaps some confirmation it’s not just me, and I’m not alone. 

I work as a senior information security manager for a large corporation and I’m so close to total burnout it’s unreal. I just don’t know how much more of this I can take.

The role itself is really interesting and I enjoy what I do, but everyday, every conversation with engineering feels like a battle. I’ve tried everything, but nothing works. No matter how collaborative I try to be they just want to do their own thing and slow roll anything we need or ask for. This is pervasive across the whole department, from the management team down.

I’ve had multiple instances where I’ve secured funding for projects based on their costs, only to have them jack up the costs once budgets are approved.

They complain they have no resources to work on projects we’ve highlighted as priorities but then they have plenty of time for pet projects or other security items they want to do.

They cut us out of every conversation, but I don’t understand what. We’re really collaborative, we never just say ‘no’..

I’m constantly second guessing myself now and my approach. I soften everything for fear this is somehow my fault and I’m approaching things in the wrong way, but in my heart of hearts I know it’s not me.

I've been in the cyber security field for two years, and I've had good performance reviews but I am not sure if it is the career for me. In the past year I've had to spend a lot of time studying for and earning the SSCP and re-earning the Security+.

A lot of my free time is gradually getting eaten up by this job.

Things that are eating up my free time:

1.) Having to study for and earn Linux+ before the year is out. This is done after 5PM and on weekends.

2.) Having to earn a Splunk certificate before the year is out. This is also done after 5PM and on weekends.

3.) Becoming an expert on Application Security. In addition to working on the other two other requirements from my job listed above, I've been told I should be studying and absorbing information on AppSec. So, I've been doing that too - off hours, as requested.

4.) Return to office. I'm now losing at least an hour a week of personal time from the commute to the office. More days will be required soon too, from what I've been told as we're said the goal is to get everyone back in 5 days a week. 

5.) Getting late night calls when alerts go off.

6.) Getting more and more tasks assigned to me that can only be done after hours and on weekends (running scans, validating changes work, and so on).



I'm not 100% sure this is the career path for me if this is going to be the next 20 years of my life, and that's fine. I don't know if I should try to look for other cyber security jobs at other companies, or if this is par for the course in the field and I need to adjust my study plan to migrate into something else career wise.

150 questions. It was difficult but I didn't take the full 4 hours. I finished in about 2.5 hours.

I struggled with the legal portion of the exam - never my strong suite, but the data protection, infrastructure security, and cloud concepts were easier. 

If I had to offer a piece of advice:

Read the entire question and all the answers at least 2 times -- read every word! I had some questions where I would think that the answer was A, but I re-read the question and saw one word that I didn't notice before and I changed my answer to B. Every word matters! The questions are purposely written to make you think it through - it's not as easy as question -> answer. There are multiple right answers, and you have to find the best one.

My studying XP might be different than yours - I got the book/test bundle and read through the CSA guide. Some might need more, some might need less - but I recommend the official Sybex book bundle -- well written and it goes over most of the topics on the exam.

1b9mg72,"Discussion thread: Actionable advice to mitigate burnout
In 2022, a study by Yerbo found over 40% of tech workers have felt burnout and were ready to quit.
  

  
My issue with burnout articles is they tend to offer vague suggestions and end with a sales pitch. Honestly the key is in the Serenity Prayer
: accept the things you cannot change, be brave enough to change what you can, and be wise enough to know the difference.

Start with Root Cause: Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, and Greater Good say the top causes of burnout are:
  
·       Perceived lack of control
  
·       Lack of clear expectations of you or the role

1gdqpjt,"Frustrated with being an intern, despite feeling like a full-timer.
I'm going to sound an ungrateful SOB (and probably get some flack for it) to all those who have yet to secure internships or any cyber related position but....

I HATE being an intern. Don’t get me wrong, I’m beyond grateful to even have a position in today’s job market, but the title feels like a punch in the face considering the effort I’m putting in. I’ve worked hard, get regular praise from colleagues for my work, and they genuinely value what I bring to the team. But somehow, it feels like I'm playing the ""intern"" game wrong.

There’s not much expected of you as an intern. They say you’re mostly there to learn, but how can I stand around and just learn all day? Well, obviously no sane person in my field would do that. I didn’t just shadow. I took on tasks, tackled incident response, got brought into projects, and became skilled at so many different technologies.

After six months, I felt ready for a full-time position. I was balancing school, getting certifications, and putting in real work every day to drive and make change. Of course, this is not up to me to decide when I’ll get an offer.

My company acknowledged my interest in going full-time, yet gave me the “after you graduate” talk. Due to “legal” and “tax” reasons, they said I had to stay an intern until I finish my degree in May 2025. My only thought was - *are you serious?* But really? Shouldn’t I decide how much I can handle as a student?

  
I suspect there's more to the story -  probably about budgets, but the official explanation feels like another punch in the face.

Then there’s school. My experience on the job has taught me more about cybersecurity in 14 months than my degree has in almost four years. 

The irony is that many of my colleagues don’t even have degrees in cyber. They came from different fields, took a cert or two, and got the job. Yet here I am, balancing school, getting certifications, and building real work experience—only to be told I still need the piece of paper before I can move forward.

Anyone else been in this position? How do you view the “intern” title in a positive light? And what’s the right work ethic for an intern? For me, I keep feeling like I need to match full-timers. I feel I have so much value to provide, but providing that value as an intern doesn't feel right.

As a security practitioner, we have to deal with the fast pace tickets and alerts. We don't spend time dwelling because of work overload.

Here is an AI summary of the book:

Cal Newport's ""Slow Productivity"" offers a new philosophy for achieving meaningful work without burnout, based on three key principles:

1. Do fewer things: Newport advocates for reducing commitments and obligations to focus on what truly matters. This approach allows for better results by enabling workers to concentrate on high-value tasks rather than simply being busy.
2. Work at a natural pace: Instead of constant urgency, Newport suggests giving important work the time it needs. This principle recognizes that humans are not wired for unceasing intensity, and that a more varied, natural pace leads to sustainable productivity in the long term. Strategies include making longer-term plans, doubling project timeline estimates, and introducing ""seasonality"" into work schedules.
3. Obsess over quality: Newport emphasizes the importance of producing high-quality work, even if it means missing short-term opportunities. This focus on quality both demands and enables a slower pace, leading to more meaningful career results over time.

The book argues that the modern approach to knowledge work, which often emphasizes constant activity and urgency, is unsustainable and ineffective. Instead, Newport proposes a more intentional and deliberate approach to work that aligns better with human nature and leads to more fulfilling and productive outcomes.""Slow Productivity"" challenges the culture of overwork and constant hustle, offering an alternative that aims to make work a source of meaning rather than overwhelm while still maintaining valuable output. By implementing these principles, Newport suggests that individuals can achieve better results, experience greater satisfaction in their work, and avoid burnout.",0.410351574420928,1

1fokmwn,"Regarding burnout: Understanding WHY is paramount
(Posting by request.)  
  
Burnout and Impostor Syndrome will happen several times in a security career. While many ask about *how* to overcome it, the real question is *why* *does this happen?*

IMO, the main reason is we have very demotivational work in a misunderstood field. Our field is powered by negativity, justified with skepticism, and influenced by those who don't work with us on a daily basis.

We stop bad things from happening. An exciting day at work usually involves a crime, e.g., the organization we've been tasked with defending was attacked. A good day usually means our designs worked, but nobody noticed because they were able to do their jobs.

Breaches are happening everywhere and nobody seems to get punished effectively for it. In fact, *some get jobs* - by the very government asking us to defend better - *because of it*.

Tech is evolving faster than any other field, innovative companies are trying to adopt it a few months after initial release, and we need to be at least 3 months ahead of it, which means researching beta releases and conceiving the guardrails for something that may not even be a thing.

On a personal relations level, we're not a fun group to work with. People don't like dealing with password changes, MFA, firewall rules that block them from uploading files to customers, mandatory email encryption, etc. because we get in their way.

Audits ain't fun: It's not what you did, it's what you can prove you did. You have to back up every claim with documentation, logs, etc., that you typically don't think about unless you've failed an audit before. The auditors rarely know the ins and outs of how much effort it takes to meet compliance (regardless of what some will say, it is not easy) and they've got the ear of the BoD.

Finally, there's the cost. Breaches are expensive, so we're expensive. It's not difficult to see why the CFO scrutinizes our expenses when there's not any revenue coming in from the cyber folks. As messed up as it sounds in this forum, it makes financial sense to weigh ""how much would the ransom cost?"" vs. ""how much do these 4 technologies to mitigate ransomware risk cost?""

When we get out of our rhythm and look at our own situation it's easy to stare off and ask ""why do I bother doing this?"" ...and **that's** when the burnout starts.

**So how do we counteract the above? By remembering the reason we wanted to do this in the first place. FIND YOUR WHY** (supporting your family? being on the edge of tech? protecting people?)**, print it, and use it for motivation.**

And, for the love of all things holy, have a sense of humor about it. Laugh or you'll cry.

Fellow Cyberspace Cadets and Guardians of the Grid!

I seek your counsel on a matter that extends beyond our usual discussions of firewalls and encryption. In our high-stakes world of cybersecurity, how do mental health disorders affect our professional lives?

Mental health issues can impact anyone, regardless of their profession. Do any of you struggle with mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, or other disorders? Have you worked with colleagues who face these issues? I'm curious about how open people are about these struggles. Do you discuss them with your team, or do you prefer to keep them private?

For those who are open about their mental health, do you inform your HR department about your condition? Has there been a time when you had to disclose this information to HR, perhaps because you needed to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital? If so, how did HR handle it? Did you feel supported or stigmatized?

In professions like the police or military, there's often a strong stigma attached to mental health issues. Officers might fear that admitting to a mental health problem could jeopardize their career. Do you think our field of cybersecurity has a similar stigma? How would you feel if a coworker on your team was struggling with mental health issues? Would you be comfortable knowing a team member might have periods of instability, or would it make you uneasy?

Beyond common conditions like anxiety and depression, what about more serious conditions like Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder? If a colleague disclosed they had one of these conditions, how would it affect your perception of their ability to perform in our high-pressure environment?

For instance, imagine a scenario where a team member with bipolar disorder has mood swings that sometimes affect their ability to focus during critical security incidents. How would your team handle this? Would you support them, or would there be concerns about their ability to perform under pressure?

Or consider a situation where someone had to take time off for treatment related to schizophrenia. Would your team be understanding and accommodating, or would there be whispers and doubts about their reliability?

For those working as civilians for the Department of Defense (DoD), the situation can be even more complex. Civilians in DoD cybersecurity roles must pass a security clearance background check since these positions require handling information pertinent to national security. Many of us in these roles have served prior to becoming civilian employees, and if you've deployed or been around others who have, chances are you know someone with an acquired mental disorder, such as PTSD. PTSD can at times present symptoms not too different from BPD.

Does collecting VA benefits for PTSD disqualify you from these roles? Does having any mental health disorder disqualify you, or do you or others you know successfully manage their conditions while performing these critical duties?

Your insights and experiences would be incredibly valuable. How do we as a community balance the need for mental health support with the demands of our high-pressure jobs? Do you think there are ways to improve how our field handles these issues?

Thank you in advance for your candid thoughts and shared experiences.",0.524298191070556,0

Hi everyone,

I’ve been working as a SOC analyst for the past 4 years and recently joined a Big 4 firm about 3 months ago as an L2 analyst, supporting a large client. While it’s been exciting in some ways, I’m really struggling to adapt here.

Most of my teammates are already familiar with the tools and processes since they’ve been part of this project for a while. I, on the other hand, feel like I’m constantly playing catch-up. I haven’t been given access to all the tools yet, and just when I start to get a grip on something, there’s a new tool or process thrown into the mix. It’s overwhelming, and no matter how much I try, I feel like I’m not learning or contributing as much as I should be.

In my previous role with an MSS project, my tasks were mostly ticket-based, and the client-side team handled the resolution. I wasn’t directly working for a single client or communicating with end users, which, I realize now, has made the learning curve here even steeper.

On top of it, the rotational 24/7 shifts have been tough to handle. My previous job had fixed early morning shifts, which worked well for me, but this setup is really starting to take a toll. I honestly feel so overwhelmed at times that I’m considering quitting, even though this company was once my dream place to work and the pay is great.

That said, I’ve been thinking about moving away from SOC altogether and transitioning into roles like Threat Intelligence or Threat Hunting. I feel like these fields align better with my skills and interests, but I’m not sure how to start or what the roadmap looks like. Also, most cybersecurity job postings I see on LinkedIn seem to require 24/7 availability, and I wonder if that’s just the reality of the industry or if there are better options out there.

If anyone here has moved from SOC into Threat Intel or similar roles, I’d love to hear how you did it. Any advice, guidance, or even sharing your own experience would really help me right now.",0.253210455179214,0

I want to be a pentester. I am working towards OSCP, on the way, I decided to make a stop and get PJPT (because I like TCM's teaching method and delivery plus, thought of it as a step between noting and OSCP). 

When I watch the lectures or practice labs at THM or HTB, I get stuck in all sorts of unusual places. Sometimes I miss anonymous FTP logins, sometimes I miss UDP ports while scanning the target. Other times, I can smoothly capture the flag by exploiting cron jobs. Sometimes I mess up on simple configurations with Linux, forget commands and flags. Mess up python syntax, forget powershell commands, and the list goes on. I get angry with me and feel like starting from scratch (doing A+, Sec+ etc)

I do THM mostly before bed, after a day of working full time and caring for my grandmother. Sometimes I tell myself that I am plain tired and thats it, but I feel like thats an excuse I am relying too much on. 

I am applying for jr pentest roles and I am not getting any interviews, this makes me think that maybe I am not good enough. Maybe this field isnt for me. However, I dont want to give up on me, I feel like I can do this. But I also feel like I am lost.

My current company is pretty decent overall. Great people and culture, okay salary, ""unlimited"" PTO (that's not even real, I don't know how that term even flies anymore), and I do get to work remote. Problem is that I am either bored to tears on days with minimal work or I am working 60+ hour weeks with travel, onsite consulting, etc. and not much balance in between. It's affecting my personal happiness and relationships, I'm getting burnt out, and I don't like where this is headed. I'm starting to dread the daily mundane nature of my work that I once had such a genuine interest in. I still love parts of it, but man, it just doesn't have the flair it once did.

Since the beginning of the year, I have applied to somewhere near 200 positions that are local / onsite or remote for a vast range of industries. I've been spending a lot of time prowling LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, InfoSec Jobs, TrueUp, USAJobs, and countless random software / startup companies that I am attracted to hoping that one day I find my next stepping stone. I've had ONE phone interview between all of this, for an underpaid position, that turned out to be a flop. They literally told me that the position no longer exists and they don't have the budget for it. I have received countless ""Thanks for applying..."" emails with zero luck and it's beginning to feel like I took a wrong turn somewhere or luck is not on my side. I understand that the economy isn't amazing and this is an extremely saturated market in mid-2024, but am I missing something? I'm at the point of picking up a local IT / SysAdmin job just to have a more exciting change of pace while the InfoSec industry figures itself out. Am I crazy? 

Apologies for the long rant here, but thanks for reading. And to the newcomers in the industry - don't be scared by these posts. We'll all find our spot eventually, and I wish you luck in your endeavors.",0.312622249126434,0

1fwi2zz,"A Reckless Endeavor; Will I Ruin My Life? - unProfessional Student.
I tried to use a throwaway, but was unable. Hopefully this doesn't bite me.

Also, I read the FAQ and believe this is within the framework provided. (hopefully, as I really need this interaction)

I am not here to be swayed away from this, nor will I be receptive to any attempt to add to the natural fear I already feel about recent and future events in my life. With that out of the way, I come here asking for any advice, tips, tools, secrets.. anything you have that will help me with what I am about to divulge below.

I want to start this by saying thank you, truly.

I currently have a full time job that I am dissatisfied with. I make enough money to support myself and my family, but at 31 years old, it is starting to feel truly dead-end. This feeling has been growing for some time of course, as most things do, and it is now to a crown.

Around a month and some days ago, I was lying in bed, incredibly ill. I was having fever dreams between episodes of Charmed, and for some reason or another began to ruminate on a recent experience in the workplace. My company, along with thousands of others, got caught in the CDK Global ransomware event. It was chaos like I have never seen, and it fascinated me. From there, I began to think about other things that have happened in the workplace, such as vendor imposters attempting to get pay card information, smart-key cloning and vehicle theft, invoice fraud, etc.

Somehow, this left me with a business idea. Before I could think further, I'm researching what business structure to use, legal interests surrounding the type of work, market research relative to the field, etc. I reached out to a few businesses I have working relationships with and I'm sitting here now with a two week trial run lined up that starts in a week. At the end of this run I will compile and present all data I have collected. If they like what they see, I will be drawing up a contract and officially serving my first client on January 1, 2025.  I have already selected my LLC name and DBA. My mission statement is cemented and I have my presentation materials nearly finalized. I have the forms to register as a foreign entity in the home state of my prospective client as well as my domestic paperwork. I'm fully in, and still reaching out to other businesses. I am stupid, but something is forcing me to keep doing this. I'm in deep, and I can't go back now. I have to keep going forward, failure be damned.

The business venture is pretty straightforward. It focuses on the human side of security. Specifically social engineering and risk-management. It will operate as a monthly service, with opt-in/out programs suited for the businesses needs. Throughout the month, my business will try to collect information from the company through various means such as phishing, phone calls, fake invoices, on-site asset risks, after-hours penetration tests, etc. Through each action, data will be recorded and compiled into a report consisting of gross risk, divided by category. Phone calls, photos of risked assets like keys, tools, documents will also be included. Positive reinforcement will be provided where the business does well, and training will be offered to individual new-hires and groups of existing employees when needed or requested.

So of course, with my reckless charge into starting a business in a field I have no business being a business owner in, I enrolled into school. I will be attending SNHU for a BA in Cybersecurity with a concentration in Data Analysis. I am fully aware that this is an incredibly demanding career path intellectually. I fully understand that I have no understanding. I am a blank slate. The only advantage I have for myself is that I've been playing with computers since I was a single-digit child. I have very little programming experience aside from HTML/CSS and a crappy language called Blitz+ that I used to make a b-tier Pong clone. I am fairly good at math because I don't just memorize formulas, I learn why they work, which helps me retain the ideas behind what different types of data reflect. I know that this line of work is something I am capable of doing, and feel I may enjoy.

When I was in my early twenties, I had no idea what I was doing, and so I let my life stagnate. The last 10 years has been a blur, but something has stirred in me and I can't stop it. I don't have any interest in stopping it, either. I have never been this motivated nor this scared before. It is like something awoke in me. Maybe it is because I went on a diet and got healthy this year, or because I had an idea and some took me seriously. Whatever it is, I have no interest in walking away, so if you can support me in my struggle to be more than I am today, share with me what you can.

  
I will be forever grateful, more than you may realize.



Thank you,

Hi everyone! This post is for you to share what you love and what you don’t about working in cybersecurity. I’ll start by giving you my perspective from the world of software development.

I’ve been working as a software developer for 3 years now, and after going through a tough consultancy job, I’m now at a good company where the work is pretty chill, and the salaries are decent. However, despite these advantages, I’m starting to feel increasingly bored. What frustrates me the most is the feeling that projects never end. No matter what I accomplish in a day, there’s always something left to do, and the next day, I have to pick up right where I left off. This creates a sense of “dread” because I know I’ll be facing the same issue tomorrow, and when I solve it, the cycle repeats. There’s never a day where I feel mentally clear and satisfied because everything’s wrapped up. That lack of closure makes the days feel endless.

On the flip side, there are good things too. The satisfaction of completing a project when everything goes well is an emotional high. But over time, even that doesn’t seem like enough for me anymore.

I’d love to hear about your experiences in cybersecurity. What are your days like? Do you feel the same monotony, or is it different? Cybersecurity has always intrigued me, and I’m seriously considering making the switch.

Evening all, 

Currently working for a good company in financial services. Good pay, people, manager; however the culture has gone massively down hill, no progression whatsoever, the demands are sky high causing extreme context switching and stress - to a point that I ended up in hospital recently and its highly likely related to work related stress; so when I was sitting there in the hospital ward, I decided I must move on.

Got offered a role today by a bigger company, pay is slightly less but I am negotiating to get at least the same; clear challenges with less areas to focus on so I'm hoping that equates to less stress and context switching, although slightly more travel.

I've been with my current employer for nearly 10 years, so I am a little anxious about moving on. I will lose my RSUs, but that's fine, I just can't handle the extreme context switching - I feel like Im not delivering quality as I don't have the time to focus properly, and that is becoming a vicious circle.

I am fairly certain that other people are not working on anything, or at least are getting much more downtime, and this makes me feel bitter. Some projects are vastly different than others and require learning so many new things in short periods of time that I feel like I am lost and drowning. Some projects have many stalls caused by client issues, then they flip out and try to rush us through the actual work.

Hey r/Cybersecurity! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I wanted to share my experience and some advice for those embarking on the journey of self-studying cybersecurity.

## The Challenge

Let's be real: starting your cybersecurity journey can feel like trying to drink from a firehose. The field is vast, constantly evolving, and can be overwhelming at first. You might find yourself lost in a sea of acronyms, struggling to understand complex concepts, or feeling like you're always three steps behind.

But here's the thing: **every single professional in this field started exactly where you are now.**

## The Mindset

1. **Embrace the struggle**: Each challenge you face is an opportunity to learn and grow. The frustration you feel when tackling a difficult concept? That's your brain expanding.

2. **Consistency over intensity**: It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than to burn out with 8-hour cram sessions.

3. **Build a foundation**: Start with the basics. Networking, operating systems, and programming fundamentals are your building blocks.

## The Path

1. **Start with the CompTIA trifecta**: A+, Network+, and Security+. These certs will give you a solid foundation.

2. **Hands-on practice**: Set up a home lab. Break things. Fix them. Repeat.

3. **Dive into resources**: 
   - Platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox
   - Books: ""The Web Application Hacker's Handbook"" and ""The Hacker Playbook"" series
   - YouTube channels: NetworkChuck, John Hammond, David Bombal

4. **Join the community**: Engage in forums like this one, join Discord servers, attend local meetups or virtual conferences.

5. **Specialize**: Once you have a grasp of the basics, dive deeper into areas that interest you (e.g., network security, malware analysis, pen testing).

## The Reality Check

You will feel lost. You will question if you're cut out for this. You will have moments where nothing seems to make sense.

But then, something magical happens. You'll solve a CTF challenge that seemed impossible a month ago. You'll explain a complex concept to someone else and realize how far you've come. You'll look back and be amazed at your progress.

Remember: **Every lesson learned is knowledge gained**. Your journey might be rough, but it's also incredibly rewarding.

To those just starting: Welcome to one of the most exciting, challenging, and important fields out there. You've got this!

The corporations I've worked for don't care about mental health. I've worked more than I feel is necessary. I'd like to know if anybody here has left Cybersecurity for something else, and how you were able to make that shift. I feel it's best I part ways, but am really not sure how or where to go.",0.311325907707214,1

Hello everyone,

I’ll get straight to the point, so basically i’ve been interviewing for this company and things had been going really well up until today, i’ve had 2 interviews and they both went amazing.
However today, on the 3rd and last interview, which i was told there wasnt really gonna be a “technical questions” component because that was on the 2nd interview. 
I was suddenly asked a few questions and i just froze, like everything i’ve been studying disappeared from my brain.
Worst part is after the interview ended everything came Back to me and i suddenly knew how to answer the questions.
Im not used to freeze under pressure, and this is not something that normally happens to me, but i have no idea what happened in that moment, but my mind just forgot everything.
I think ill need a miracle to get the job now, even after the first 2 interviews being Good ones.

1g9ipw6,"Preparing for My First 48-Hour CTF – Feeling Nervous!
Hey everyone,

I recently got a chance to participate in a 48-hour pentesting evaluation challenge as part of a recruitment process for a Security Analyst position on Thursday. This will be my first-ever CTF-like experience, and to be honest, I’m nervous.

I’ve tried CTFs before but have never been successful in completing any of them. This makes me a bit anxious about how well I’ll perform, especially since this test seems quite critical to move forward in the hiring process. The tasks will involve multiple areas like web, mobile, and network security, and I’ll need to take screenshots of each solved task to submit as proof.

I’m hoping this challenge will be a good learning experience no matter what the outcome is. Any advice on how to approach a 48-hour exam or handle pressure during such challenges would be greatly appreciated! Also, if you’ve been through something similar, I’d love to hear about your experience and how you prepared for it.

Wish me luck! I’ll do my best to make it through and learn as much as I can.Thanks for reading and for any tips you can share!",0.263771325349807,0

Hi Everyone,
  

  
I'm doing a college paper on the effects and working in the Tech Industry for my Psych class
  

  
Feel free to message me if you'd like to jump on a 5 minute call, or want to give me the answers privately
  

  
But if not, I was hoping any of you could answer some of these questions.
  

  
It would greatly help me:
  

  
1. What is frustrating (or annoying) you right now with your stress level?  

2. What have you been told to do in the past that hasn't worked?  

3. If you could work out 1 problem around stress with a therapist, what would that be?  

4. What is 1 thing you have experienced while working with stress that you wish more people talked about/had more support around
  
5. If you could have less stress, what would that look like?
  
6. What is the missing piece for your life to get to less stress?
  
7. What do you find most annoying about your stress levels
  
Additional questions (if you're brave):
  
1. Is there a story about stress that you never want to experience again
  
2. What do you find annoying about stress and engineering? If you could choose 1 thing about stress and control it 100%, what would that be
  
3. If you went to a therapist, and got a call for free, What is the one question you would ask
  
4. What is your goal with controlling stress? What would change for you if this was achieved  

  
Thank you sooo much!!

1gprrtz,"Which SMB industries are serious about cybersecurity?
I've noticed that some industries, like healthcare in certain regions, aren't as serious about cybersecurity, often due to budget constraints, lack of tech resources, or other reasons. For example, in the US, healthcare is generally seen as a challenging sector for cybersecurity professionals, with numerous posts discussing the struggles they face:

However, I've noticed that cybersecurity emphasis seems to vary widely by industry and even by country. For instance, healthcare in certain European countries might take cybersecurity much more seriously. I’d love to get insights from the community:

Let me start off with saying that I am a person with ADHD and currently work as a Security Architect.

For the past few months I cannot handle my job. I feel burnt out, I feel like everything I do is boring and monotonous. I do the same things every day and I no longer want to expand my knowledge at work. I don't want to take on new tasks as it all feels similar to me and isn't motivating enough to continue with it. I was considering starting with pentesting but with ADHD it is incredibly hard as any obstacle just stops me from trying. 

I start reading about ethical hacking, pentesting, programming and I get excited but the moment I try it, I just get bored of it instantly.

Currently I feel like maybe I cannot do any other job correctly or perhaps that I am not made for this job or even that I will end up jobless without any perspectives.

I’m not really sure what I hope to achieve by posting this, perhaps some confirmation it’s not just me, and I’m not alone. 

I work as a senior information security manager for a large corporation and I’m so close to total burnout it’s unreal. I just don’t know how much more of this I can take.

The role itself is really interesting and I enjoy what I do, but everyday, every conversation with engineering feels like a battle. I’ve tried everything, but nothing works. No matter how collaborative I try to be they just want to do their own thing and slow roll anything we need or ask for. This is pervasive across the whole department, from the management team down.

I’ve had multiple instances where I’ve secured funding for projects based on their costs, only to have them jack up the costs once budgets are approved.

They complain they have no resources to work on projects we’ve highlighted as priorities but then they have plenty of time for pet projects or other security items they want to do.

They cut us out of every conversation, but I don’t understand what. We’re really collaborative, we never just say ‘no’..

I’m constantly second guessing myself now and my approach. I soften everything for fear this is somehow my fault and I’m approaching things in the wrong way, but in my heart of hearts I know it’s not me.
