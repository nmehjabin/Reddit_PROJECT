Hello Everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I am a master's student currently working on my thesis.

My research focuses on understanding the impact of different work environments (traditional office, work-from-home, and hybrid models) on burnout among IT professionals. My goal for this study is to better understand how various work arrangements affect stress levels, job satisfaction, and overall wellbeing in the IT industry.

Your participation is completely voluntary, and all your responses will be kept confidential. The survey will take approximately 10-15 minutes to complete. No compensation will be provided for participation.

### Opening Statement

In argument theory, there's a concept of a false dichotomy. Within a false dichotomy, we assess that things can be good or bad. It's time to leave or stay. I'm burned out or I'm passionate. It's a natural human decision tree method, which makes decisions binary and - in some cases- that's easier than having options. (Un)fortunately, life is rarely so binary - despite our careers literally being about ones and zeroes.

I've been a community member here for a while across different accounts. On a given day, you'll see at least one post about ""HoW dO I bEcOmE a L33T H@xor wItHOuT DoInG mY oWn ReSeArCh?"" and it's balanced out with ""How do I get out?"". If it weren't so frequent that we see the same two posts day in and day out, it would be funny.

The goal of this post is to provide you options to assess what's in the decimal points between 1 and 0, and hopefully some of the tricks and strategies will help you.
  
### Tricks to be discussed:

- Challenge the status quo
- Diversify your value streams
- Intra-preneurship [Not a typo]

### Why Me?

Before I start, I want to give my obligitory ""why does my opinion matter?"". Brutally honest - it doesn't. This is just some more text in the world that's repeating great things others have said before. Ego inflating - I've launched and sold a successful security start up, worked for fortune 5 companies, and I'm an ex-lifeguard at the YMCA.

### Disclaimers

I'm not a mental health professional and the advice I'm giving should be taking with that in mind. There are mental health challenges, temporary or chronic, that may be associated with thoughts of being trapped into a situation. This advice is intended to be taken broadly and with a slab of salt.

### Challenge the Status Quo

I have yet to be in a single business where the processes were perfect, everything worked like a well oiled machine, and it was sunshine and rainbows. If you have a workplace like this, and you're reading this article, kindly go climb a tree. This is for the rest of us who live on earth.

With the status quo often comes things like routine, manual tasks that offer minimal value. There are standing meetings that don't make sense. There are boundaries that you aren't allowed to cross, even though the fix is right in plain sight. It can entrap you into a box of function that feels self defeating in many ways. On the other hand...

The status quo may come with such disorganized chaos that nothing is getting done. Everyone complains about issues all the time, but nothing is getting done about any of them. The backlog (if there even is one) is so long and out of date that the thought of prioritizing and executing it requires mental stamina that only tibetan monks have attained. It's crazy out there.

In either situation, I find that a lot of people stuck in the status quo feel helpless to change things and don't feel like they have options. Depending on the company, that may be true, but there are some things to try before giving up.

In any situations where you are challenging the status quo, it needs to be done with respect for why the tape (or chaos) is there. The best way to justify doing what you see as important is to understand the biggest pain points in the business and tackling them. This means talking with your management and other stake holders to see what's bothering them.

Once you have a good sense of the boundaries and challenges that exist, you can start to put together a strategy for dealing with them. Most boundaries are there for good reasons, but sometimes they need to be adjusted. This is where a proof of concept comes into play. Often times when I have an idea for a change, the most effetive way to get support is to put something in a decision maker's hand that shows the change. This could be a script, or a diagram, or a spreadsheet; it just needs to show the value you're bringing.

#### An anecdote --

Once upon a time, I worked at a large utility company and I'm pretty sure the entire thing was built with red tape. I've never spent more time or energy on documentation and process than I did at that organization, so it definitely fell into the first status quo definiton. While my time there was cut short by a certain pandemic, I was quite successful in my role ther and still have many good relationships from the role.

What helped me succeed in the role was doing what I knew needed to be done rather than waiting for a process to complete. The project needed a script built and the devs were busy? I wrote one. We needed to parse and analyze 16GB of logs a day and I had a 6th gen U processor to do it with? Time to learn rust. We needed a business primer on MFA methods? I crafted one. We needed a financial projection for different solutions? I built it.

Instead of being constrained to what my job title was, I actively filled gaps and drove success. I prioritized the biggest pain points and allowed the noisy red tape to whine in the background unless it really was urgent. Along the way, I built the relationships with key people in the organization who also wanted change but needed help showing the path forward.

On the flipside, I had a colleague who was such a rule follower, he genuinely struggled in his role. On top of that, his manager was quite strict in his persuit of delivery. For months I watched the colleague flail about, until one day I snapped at him. 

I pointed out that he wasn't likely going to be perfect at attaining all the written expectations for his role given the amount of tape. In that situation, demonstrating value by completing work was more important than being perfect at following the red lines. When he let go of trying to do everything by the book, and focus on getting things done he felt more empowered to do his job and was actually recognized for it. The manager who had been overbearing came to be trusting instead.

### Diversify your value streams

Originally, I had this section titled for income streams, but I realize that was a single minded approach. In reality, a lot of the times we feel stuck because we don't have other engagements in our lives. Those could be side hustles, hobbies, or community work but they should all be something that keeps you engaged in something else. This (then) excludes mindless activities that lead to less fulfillment, such as watching TV.

Now, I'm not attacking watching TV. There's a time and place for sitting in front of the screen and getting lost in a story or catching up on the news. However, activities like this or doom scrolling have been demonstrated to do little for our motivation and sense of fulfillment. In fact, at too much exposure they can demotivate and defalte our sense of self.

For me, I have found the freelancing keeps me well engaged. I get to learn and solve different problems, often for temporary clients so nothing to long or boring after a period of time. I've also donated a lot of time to local non-profits to support their IT and provide teaching to those who want to get into the field. All these activities are outside of my work hours and keep me engaged by forcing my focus onto other activities for a while. 

Note on the excuse of having families: I have one. Four kids, a disabled wife, and all the extras that brings. As the single income earner for the family, I do a lot to keep them taken care of, but I still make time to play Minecraft with the kids, build legos, build camp fires, etc. with them. Most of my side work is done early morning or after the kids go to bed.

### Intra-preneurship

Now, some of you don't want to or aren't allowed (by your employment agreement) to seek externaml work. In any case, I highly recommend at looking in your business and seeing if there are opportunities for you to take on responsibilities that align with your career goals and business need. With the exception of large enterprises (and even they have these gaps), there's more hats to be worn than people to fill them. Any start up people know this too well.

In the small-medium business category, if you really need a change of pace but like the people you're with, speak up. Create a business case for the change and demonstrate how you could make a difference in that area. You may find that you're able to build your own brand within the organization as the person who brings positive change. With the reputational growth comes increased trust and opportunity to change the status quo, drive value, and make a fulfilling career of your own chosing within the organizatoin construct. 

If you want to learn more about this specific topic, David Bet Patrick wrote a great book ""5 Steps Ahead"" that covers this and more. I recommend it.

### In Closing

These are just three techniques for fighting your sense of being trapped or stuck. Each of them allows you to create a decimal point between ""should I stay or go"" leading to options like:

- 0.0: Leave
- 0.2: Attempt Intraprenuership
- 0.5: Challenge the status quo
- 0.8: Diversify Value Steams
- 1.0: Stay

Good luck out there, and remember that jobs are a major factor in life and they aren't going to make you personally fulfilled 100% of the time. It's not any company's job to make you happy as an employee; and HR is there to make sure you're productive. This is all as it should be. Your fulfillment and happiness is largely depenent on your ability to control your response to situations. These strategies will help, and there are many others to choose from as well.",0.281245231628417,0

I’m not really sure what I hope to achieve by posting this, perhaps some confirmation it’s not just me, and I’m not alone. 

I work as a senior information security manager for a large corporation and I’m so close to total burnout it’s unreal. I just don’t know how much more of this I can take.

The role itself is really interesting and I enjoy what I do, but everyday, every conversation with engineering feels like a battle. I’ve tried everything, but nothing works. No matter how collaborative I try to be they just want to do their own thing and slow roll anything we need or ask for. This is pervasive across the whole department, from the management team down.

I’ve had multiple instances where I’ve secured funding for projects based on their costs, only to have them jack up the costs once budgets are approved.

They complain they have no resources to work on projects we’ve highlighted as priorities but then they have plenty of time for pet projects or other security items they want to do.

They cut us out of every conversation, but I don’t understand what. We’re really collaborative, we never just say ‘no’..

I've been in the cyber security field for two years, and I've had good performance reviews but I am not sure if it is the career for me. In the past year I've had to spend a lot of time studying for and earning the SSCP and re-earning the Security+.

A lot of my free time is gradually getting eaten up by this job.

Things that are eating up my free time:

1.) Having to study for and earn Linux+ before the year is out. This is done after 5PM and on weekends.

2.) Having to earn a Splunk certificate before the year is out. This is also done after 5PM and on weekends.

3.) Becoming an expert on Application Security. In addition to working on the other two other requirements from my job listed above, I've been told I should be studying and absorbing information on AppSec. So, I've been doing that too - off hours, as requested.

4.) Return to office. I'm now losing at least an hour a week of personal time from the commute to the office. More days will be required soon too, from what I've been told as we're said the goal is to get everyone back in 5 days a week. 

5.) Getting late night calls when alerts go off.

6.) Getting more and more tasks assigned to me that can only be done after hours and on weekends (running scans, validating changes work, and so on).



I'm not 100% sure this is the career path for me if this is going to be the next 20 years of my life, and that's fine. I don't know if I should try to look for other cyber security jobs at other companies, or if this is par for the course in the field and I need to adjust my study plan to migrate into something else career wise.

1focakd,"Burnout in cybersecurity
Hey all,

I've been working in cybersecurity for several years now, mainly across the energy sector in some very large enterprise environments. I have always been on the blue team side of things and have spent a considerable amount of time grinding at each employer; continuous learning through obtaining many certs, attending conferences, and striving to be a high performer in the workplace by taking on as much work as I could so I'd be recognized as somebody of importance and value to the org. I want to be someone people can trust and depend on to get things done. 

Through this, I found myself reaching the top of the pay scale as an individual contributor at my current org with a few years and transitioned into a cyber management role over a year ago. I was not necessarily prepared for this. I had no prior management experience and I did not really have a mentor, or a boss willing to share their knowledge with me.

Within the last 6 months I'm feeling so incredibly burned out. It's to the point where I don't care if I get fired/laid off. In fact, I long for it. All I think about is work, how much is one my plate and how much I can't stand it. Even when I am productive I get no enjoyment or fulfilment out of it. None of the projects interest me and it's so hard to push through. 

What are some things I can do to get myself out of this? I've taken time off to try and ""recharge"", yet I come back feeling worse and filled with existential dread. I'm very grateful for my career, but it is weighing very heavily on me. Any advice from those that have experienced this?",0.336816191673278,1

Took the exam today -> Passed it!

150 questions. It was difficult but I didn't take the full 4 hours. I finished in about 2.5 hours.

I struggled with the legal portion of the exam - never my strong suite, but the data protection, infrastructure security, and cloud concepts were easier. 

If I had to offer a piece of advice:

Read the entire question and all the answers at least 2 times -- read every word! I had some questions where I would think that the answer was A, but I re-read the question and saw one word that I didn't notice before and I changed my answer to B. Every word matters! The questions are purposely written to make you think it through - it's not as easy as question -> answer. There are multiple right answers, and you have to find the best one.

My studying XP might be different than yours - I got the book/test bundle and read through the CSA guide. Some might need more, some might need less - but I recommend the official Sybex book bundle -- well written and it goes over most of the topics on the exam.  Took me about a month to finish it and understand the concepts.

I'm not a video learner - I need to read, so I didn't do any video based courses.

1b9mg72,"Discussion thread: Actionable advice to mitigate burnout
In 2022, a study by Yerbo found over 40% of tech workers have felt burnout and were ready to quit.
  

  
My issue with burnout articles is they tend to offer vague suggestions and end with a sales pitch. Honestly the key is in the Serenity Prayer
: accept the things you cannot change, be brave enough to change what you can, and be wise enough to know the difference.

Start with Root Cause: Mayo Clinic, Kaiser Permanente, and Greater Good say the top causes of burnout are:
  
·       Perceived lack of control
  
·       Lack of clear expectations of you or the role
  
·       Heavy workloads/Unreasonable deadlines
  
·       Poor relationships/Lack of support/Unfair treatment
  
·       Problems with work-life balance
  

  
I will add ""A persistent stream of negativity"" to the pile.
  

  
The good news is it can be manageable if we (and our leaders) are open, alert, and supportive. The bad news is you need to do much of the work yourself. 

Retention is vital, and this is an opportunity to improve engagement, perception, and overall health. Please join me in putting actionable advice in the comments.",0.551355004310607,1
1gdqpjt,"Frustrated with being an intern, despite feeling like a full-timer.
I'm going to sound an ungrateful SOB (and probably get some flack for it) to all those who have yet to secure internships or any cyber related position but....

I HATE being an intern. Don’t get me wrong, I’m beyond grateful to even have a position in today’s job market, but the title feels like a punch in the face considering the effort I’m putting in. I’ve worked hard, get regular praise from colleagues for my work, and they genuinely value what I bring to the team. But somehow, it feels like I'm playing the ""intern"" game wrong.

There’s not much expected of you as an intern. They say you’re mostly there to learn, but how can I stand around and just learn all day? Well, obviously no sane person in my field would do that. I didn’t just shadow. I took on tasks, tackled incident response, got brought into projects, and became skilled at so many different technologies.

After six months, I felt ready for a full-time position. I was balancing school, getting certifications, and putting in real work every day to drive and make change. Of course, this is not up to me to decide when I’ll get an offer.

My company acknowledged my interest in going full-time, yet gave me the “after you graduate” talk. Due to “legal” and “tax” reasons, they said I had to stay an intern until I finish my degree in May 2025. My only thought was - *are you serious?* But really? Shouldn’t I decide how much I can handle as a student?

  
I suspect there's more to the story -  probably about budgets, but the official explanation feels like another punch in the face.

Then there’s school. My experience on the job has taught me more about cybersecurity in 14 months than my degree has in almost four years. 

The irony is that many of my colleagues don’t even have degrees in cyber. They came from different fields, took a cert or two, and got the job. Yet here I am, balancing school, getting certifications, and building real work experience—only to be told I still need the piece of paper before I can move forward.

Anyone else been in this position? How do you view the “intern” title in a positive light? And what’s the right work ethic for an intern? For me, I keep feeling like I need to match full-timers. I feel I have so much value to provide, but providing that value as an intern doesn't feel right.

As a security practitioner, we have to deal with the fast pace tickets and alerts. We don't spend time dwelling because of work overload.

Here is an AI summary of the book:

Cal Newport's ""Slow Productivity"" offers a new philosophy for achieving meaningful work without burnout, based on three key principles:

1. Do fewer things: Newport advocates for reducing commitments and obligations to focus on what truly matters. This approach allows for better results by enabling workers to concentrate on high-value tasks rather than simply being busy.
2. Work at a natural pace: Instead of constant urgency, Newport suggests giving important work the time it needs. This principle recognizes that humans are not wired for unceasing intensity, and that a more varied, natural pace leads to sustainable productivity in the long term. Strategies include making longer-term plans, doubling project timeline estimates, and introducing ""seasonality"" into work schedules.
3. Obsess over quality: Newport emphasizes the importance of producing high-quality work, even if it means missing short-term opportunities. This focus on quality both demands and enables a slower pace, leading to more meaningful career results over time.

The book argues that the modern approach to knowledge work, which often emphasizes constant activity and urgency, is unsustainable and ineffective. Instead, Newport proposes a more intentional and deliberate approach to work that aligns better with human nature and leads to more fulfilling and productive outcomes.""Slow Productivity"" challenges the culture of overwork and constant hustle, offering an alternative that aims to make work a source of meaning rather than overwhelm while still maintaining valuable output. By implementing these principles, Newport suggests that individuals can achieve better results, experience greater satisfaction in their work, and avoid burnout.",0.410351574420928,1

(Posting by request.)  
  
Burnout and Impostor Syndrome will happen several times in a security career. While many ask about *how* to overcome it, the real question is *why* *does this happen?*

IMO, the main reason is we have very demotivational work in a misunderstood field. Our field is powered by negativity, justified with skepticism, and influenced by those who don't work with us on a daily basis.

We stop bad things from happening. An exciting day at work usually involves a crime, e.g., the organization we've been tasked with defending was attacked. A good day usually means our designs worked, but nobody noticed because they were able to do their jobs.

Breaches are happening everywhere and nobody seems to get punished effectively for it. In fact, *some get jobs* - by the very government asking us to defend better - *because of it*.

Tech is evolving faster than any other field, innovative companies are trying to adopt it a few months after initial release, and we need to be at least 3 months ahead of it, which means researching beta releases and conceiving the guardrails for something that may not even be a thing.

On a personal relations level, we're not a fun group to work with. People don't like dealing with password changes, MFA, firewall rules that block them from uploading files to customers, mandatory email encryption, etc. because we get in their way.

Audits ain't fun: It's not what you did, it's what you can prove you did. You have to back up every claim with documentation, logs, etc., that you typically don't think about unless you've failed an audit before. The auditors rarely know the ins and outs of how much effort it takes to meet compliance (regardless of what some will say, it is not easy) and they've got the ear of the BoD.

Finally, there's the cost. Breaches are expensive, so we're expensive. It's not difficult to see why the CFO scrutinizes our expenses when there's not any revenue coming in from the cyber folks. As messed up as it sounds in this forum, it makes financial sense to weigh ""how much would the ransom cost?"" vs. ""how much do these 4 technologies to mitigate ransomware risk cost?""

When we get out of our rhythm and look at our own situation it's easy to stare off and ask ""why do I bother doing this?"" ...and **that's** when the burnout starts.

**So how do we counteract the above? By remembering the reason we wanted to do this in the first place. FIND YOUR WHY** (supporting your family? being on the edge of tech? protecting people?)**, print it, and use it for motivation.**

And, for the love of all things holy, have a sense of humor about it. Laugh or you'll cry.

Fellow Cyberspace Cadets and Guardians of the Grid!

I seek your counsel on a matter that extends beyond our usual discussions of firewalls and encryption. In our high-stakes world of cybersecurity, how do mental health disorders affect our professional lives?

Mental health issues can impact anyone, regardless of their profession. Do any of you struggle with mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, or other disorders? Have you worked with colleagues who face these issues? I'm curious about how open people are about these struggles. Do you discuss them with your team, or do you prefer to keep them private?

For those who are open about their mental health, do you inform your HR department about your condition? Has there been a time when you had to disclose this information to HR, perhaps because you needed to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital? If so, how did HR handle it? Did you feel supported or stigmatized?

In professions like the police or military, there's often a strong stigma attached to mental health issues. Officers might fear that admitting to a mental health problem could jeopardize their career. Do you think our field of cybersecurity has a similar stigma? How would you feel if a coworker on your team was struggling with mental health issues? Would you be comfortable knowing a team member might have periods of instability, or would it make you uneasy?

Beyond common conditions like anxiety and depression, what about more serious conditions like Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder? If a colleague disclosed they had one of these conditions, how would it affect your perception of their ability to perform in our high-pressure environment?

For instance, imagine a scenario where a team member with bipolar disorder has mood swings that sometimes affect their ability to focus during critical security incidents. How would your team handle this? Would you support them, or would there be concerns about their ability to perform under pressure?

Or consider a situation where someone had to take time off for treatment related to schizophrenia. Would your team be understanding and accommodating, or would there be whispers and doubts about their reliability?

For those working as civilians for the Department of Defense (DoD), the situation can be even more complex. Civilians in DoD cybersecurity roles must pass a security clearance background check since these positions require handling information pertinent to national security. Many of us in these roles have served prior to becoming civilian employees, and if you've deployed or been around others who have, chances are you know someone with an acquired mental disorder, such as PTSD. PTSD can at times present symptoms not too different from BPD.

Does collecting VA benefits for PTSD disqualify you from these roles? Does having any mental health disorder disqualify you, or do you or others you know successfully manage their conditions while performing these critical duties?

Your insights and experiences would be incredibly valuable. How do we as a community balance the need for mental health support with the demands of our high-pressure jobs? Do you think there are ways to improve how our field handles these issues?

Thank you in advance for your candid thoughts and shared experiences.",0.524298191070556,1

1gduly2,"Burnout rant
I've been studying all things IT/cyber for over a decade now. And not just amateurishly clicking around forums and doing a few boxes. I mean utterly pathologically and obsessively researching; building systems and networks, breaking into them, patching them, re-writing them; trying to cram as many years of experience as possible in as little time as possible. Over and over again, a never ending cycle of deep-dives and retracting back to the basics to make sure my foundations were solid, and back to more deep-dives.

Basic networking, linux/windows sysadmin skills (i.e package management, scripting, Infra-as-code, etc), ICS/SCADA, radio manipulation, embedded systems, automotive security, malware dev, Appsec, DevOps, DFIR, GRC, and so on. I'd pick a certification and read every study guide I could find online for it, knowing damn well I'd never be able to pay for it. I'd implement the concepts in a home lab to solidify everything I've learned.

And after a decade of learning, meanwhile applying for jobs and rewriting my resume over and over again... I've virtually gotten nowhere. I've worked for two different start-up companies that dissolved due to marketing failures, and the one established company i worked for (an MSP) had to let me go after a few months because they lost a big client. Ever since that one MSP let me go (which I'll re-iterate, was through no fault of my own), I've been stuck working in the food industry, factories and gas stations.

The worst part of it all, is that my obsession compelled me to at least try getting into the same buildings as the people who had the jobs that I wanted, which only led me to look through a proverbial glass ceiling, wishing I could be on top. An example is working at a food place on Fort Meade. I got to meet and talk to cybersecurity professionals all the time, if only in passing. For 2-3 minutes while they would wait for an order, I'd get to listen to them about what they do (albeit in a filtered way; clearances on the line and all). But at the end of the day, while I waited for the bus to go back home, all I could think is I would never get there. But I kept on pushing through anyways... for years even after that.

I worked at a gas station in Baltimore, where I also got to meet DB admins and SOC analysts as well... again, only in passing. Job after job, I'd find myself talking with highly skilled and intelligent professionals that I admire, only to feel a paradoxical rising resentment as time passed. I worked so fucking hard to be where they are, only to be the cashier that gave them their lunch and cigarettes.

As far as I know, no resume has ever gotten past an ATS and into a real person's inbox, and if it did, it was probably for a ghost job.

I'm just done, man. Pretty sure I'm just going to pivot to a career that plays to my other strengths like engineering, neuroscience or chemistry. Those student loans are gonna be real easy on my bank account. /s",0.306971430778503,1

I have been struggling with burnout after accepting a ""promotion"" to senior security engineer (I'm the only engineer) around 2 years ago.

I work at a small MSSP, 1 vCISO, 1 security architect, 1 engineer and 2 analysts that supports around 8 enterprises (in various sectors) with around 10k users total. All of the organizations use M365 (Office, Entra, Intune, Defender) and I am in charge and the main point of contact for all incidents and issues with any of our service (security related or not) and responsible for planning, deploying, updating, and supporting all configs and maintaining all documentation.

This includes Defender for Endpoint, cloud apps, Identity, Sentinel, Azure, Admin portal, Intune, Entra ID, Cisco Meraki, Cisco endpoint protection, Carbon Black, MDR portal, logic apps automation, conditional access, and others.

I also am in charge of our threat Analysts, assigning them responsibilities, creating and maintaining playbooks for them to follow, leading incident response, training them, and assisting with their day to day alert response (all alerts from the security tools are sent to our messaging tool for the analysts to review). On top of that I was tasked with redesigning and automating all analysts tasks and responsibilities with Sentinel.

Along with that I am the person anyone calls when there are any issues with anything even remotely related to any of the above and really struggling with no support from Microsoft support or vendors.

I was leading all meetings till I broke down and couldn't deal with the additional stress of architecting and pitching all of the above with the different enterprises IT admins and c suite, which can be very difficult when you are young and people do not respect your knowledge or opinion.

My company has a security architect that does not want to deal with Microsoft products, leaving all of that responsibility to me.

Am I crazy or is this an insane amount of workload for one person in a MSSP that is pushing all clients to full M365 for security? All enterprises are onboard with this but some admins and techs do not like Microsoft leading them to troubleshoot issues for 5 minutes before sending it to me.

My main issue is the lack of support from the top levels of my org and the enterprises we service making all the above even more difficult to track and maintain configs and issues across 8 enterprises by myself.",0.346712738275527,1

1hg5old,"Seeking Guidance on Transitioning from SOC to Threat Intelligence
Hi everyone,

I’ve been working as a SOC analyst for the past 4 years and recently joined a Big 4 firm about 3 months ago as an L2 analyst, supporting a large client. While it’s been exciting in some ways, I’m really struggling to adapt here.

Most of my teammates are already familiar with the tools and processes since they’ve been part of this project for a while. I, on the other hand, feel like I’m constantly playing catch-up. I haven’t been given access to all the tools yet, and just when I start to get a grip on something, there’s a new tool or process thrown into the mix. It’s overwhelming, and no matter how much I try, I feel like I’m not learning or contributing as much as I should be.

In my previous role with an MSS project, my tasks were mostly ticket-based, and the client-side team handled the resolution. I wasn’t directly working for a single client or communicating with end users, which, I realize now, has made the learning curve here even steeper.

On top of it, the rotational 24/7 shifts have been tough to handle. My previous job had fixed early morning shifts, which worked well for me, but this setup is really starting to take a toll. I honestly feel so overwhelmed at times that I’m considering quitting, even though this company was once my dream place to work and the pay is great.

That said, I’ve been thinking about moving away from SOC altogether and transitioning into roles like Threat Intelligence or Threat Hunting. I feel like these fields align better with my skills and interests, but I’m not sure how to start or what the roadmap looks like. Also, most cybersecurity job postings I see on LinkedIn seem to require 24/7 availability, and I wonder if that’s just the reality of the industry or if there are better options out there.

If anyone here has moved from SOC into Threat Intel or similar roles, I’d love to hear how you did it. Any advice, guidance, or even sharing your own experience would really help me right now.",0.253210455179214,1
1gipr35,"Would 70 hours be enough to prepare for a FAANG interview for a security engineer position?
Please let me know if it isn't okay for me to post this here! None of my friends are in the same field so I'm resorting to posting about it. Basically, I have an upcoming FAANG interview next week and I'm nervous about it. I want to know study everything. I actually had the past 4-5 days off and I wanted to put in 30-40 hours of work but that didn't pan out. By the end of today, during the course of 5 days, I would have put maybe around 25 hours into studying, which is basically nothing. I wanted to do 10 hour days. One of the days, I actually wasted because I was anxious about something completely irrelevant and petty (which I beat up myself pretty bad over). 

I have the rest of today, and several days off during the week to study (including next weekend), so I want to put in 50 hours of studying during the course of this week. In total, before the interview next week, I would like to have put 70 hours into studying. I have a list of topics I'd like to study that seemed to relate to the job posting and I'm just taking notes for it. I will also be practicing interview questions (got a bunch of questions I found from different resources online that I can pull from), and I want to go over a couple coding-related stuff as well. I'm nervous. I've had 3.5 years of full-time experience in the field (and an additional one year as an intern).

Hi.

For context : 24M, computer science student. I work as a sysadmin+firewall admin, do inventory management, access management, write policies, and provide tech support. I started this as the first job out of college, kept getting more responsibilities and eventually got here.

I want to be a pentester. I am working towards OSCP, on the way, I decided to make a stop and get PJPT (because I like TCM's teaching method and delivery plus, thought of it as a step between noting and OSCP). 

When I watch the lectures or practice labs at THM or HTB, I get stuck in all sorts of unusual places. Sometimes I miss anonymous FTP logins, sometimes I miss UDP ports while scanning the target. Other times, I can smoothly capture the flag by exploiting cron jobs. Sometimes I mess up on simple configurations with Linux, forget commands and flags. Mess up python syntax, forget powershell commands, and the list goes on. I get angry with me and feel like starting from scratch (doing A+, Sec+ etc)

I do THM mostly before bed, after a day of working full time and caring for my grandmother. Sometimes I tell myself that I am plain tired and thats it, but I feel like thats an excuse I am relying too much on. 

I am applying for jr pentest roles and I am not getting any interviews, this makes me think that maybe I am not good enough. Maybe this field isnt for me. However, I dont want to give up on me, I feel like I can do this. But I also feel like I am lost.

1e0ab59,"Advice Needed - 10+ Years Experience
Greetings fellow nerds. I've found myself in a peculiar position - I have 10+ years of IT / InfoSec experience, am currently doing GRC / Consulting work, have my CISSP, Sec+, etc. and yet I can't seem to land an interview for the life of me.

My current company is pretty decent overall. Great people and culture, okay salary, ""unlimited"" PTO (that's not even real, I don't know how that term even flies anymore), and I do get to work remote. Problem is that I am either bored to tears on days with minimal work or I am working 60+ hour weeks with travel, onsite consulting, etc. and not much balance in between. It's affecting my personal happiness and relationships, I'm getting burnt out, and I don't like where this is headed. I'm starting to dread the daily mundane nature of my work that I once had such a genuine interest in. I still love parts of it, but man, it just doesn't have the flair it once did.

Since the beginning of the year, I have applied to somewhere near 200 positions that are local / onsite or remote for a vast range of industries. I've been spending a lot of time prowling LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, InfoSec Jobs, TrueUp, USAJobs, and countless random software / startup companies that I am attracted to hoping that one day I find my next stepping stone. I've had ONE phone interview between all of this, for an underpaid position, that turned out to be a flop. They literally told me that the position no longer exists and they don't have the budget for it. I have received countless ""Thanks for applying..."" emails with zero luck and it's beginning to feel like I took a wrong turn somewhere or luck is not on my side. I understand that the economy isn't amazing and this is an extremely saturated market in mid-2024, but am I missing something? I'm at the point of picking up a local IT / SysAdmin job just to have a more exciting change of pace while the InfoSec industry figures itself out. Am I crazy?

I tried to use a throwaway, but was unable. Hopefully this doesn't bite me.

Also, I read the FAQ and believe this is within the framework provided. (hopefully, as I really need this interaction)

I am not here to be swayed away from this, nor will I be receptive to any attempt to add to the natural fear I already feel about recent and future events in my life. With that out of the way, I come here asking for any advice, tips, tools, secrets.. anything you have that will help me with what I am about to divulge below.

I want to start this by saying thank you, truly.

I currently have a full time job that I am dissatisfied with. I make enough money to support myself and my family, but at 31 years old, it is starting to feel truly dead-end. This feeling has been growing for some time of course, as most things do, and it is now to a crown.

Around a month and some days ago, I was lying in bed, incredibly ill. I was having fever dreams between episodes of Charmed, and for some reason or another began to ruminate on a recent experience in the workplace. My company, along with thousands of others, got caught in the CDK Global ransomware event. It was chaos like I have never seen, and it fascinated me. From there, I began to think about other things that have happened in the workplace, such as vendor imposters attempting to get pay card information, smart-key cloning and vehicle theft, invoice fraud, etc.

Somehow, this left me with a business idea. Before I could think further, I'm researching what business structure to use, legal interests surrounding the type of work, market research relative to the field, etc. I reached out to a few businesses I have working relationships with and I'm sitting here now with a two week trial run lined up that starts in a week. At the end of this run I will compile and present all data I have collected. If they like what they see, I will be drawing up a contract and officially serving my first client on January 1, 2025.  I have already selected my LLC name and DBA. My mission statement is cemented and I have my presentation materials nearly finalized. I have the forms to register as a foreign entity in the home state of my prospective client as well as my domestic paperwork. I'm fully in, and still reaching out to other businesses. I am stupid, but something is forcing me to keep doing this. I'm in deep, and I can't go back now. I have to keep going forward, failure be damned.

The business venture is pretty straightforward. It focuses on the human side of security. Specifically social engineering and risk-management. It will operate as a monthly service, with opt-in/out programs suited for the businesses needs. Throughout the month, my business will try to collect information from the company through various means such as phishing, phone calls, fake invoices, on-site asset risks, after-hours penetration tests, etc. Through each action, data will be recorded and compiled into a report consisting of gross risk, divided by category. Phone calls, photos of risked assets like keys, tools, documents will also be included. Positive reinforcement will be provided where the business does well, and training will be offered to individual new-hires and groups of existing employees when needed or requested.

So of course, with my reckless charge into starting a business in a field I have no business being a business owner in, I enrolled into school. I will be attending SNHU for a BA in Cybersecurity with a concentration in Data Analysis. I am fully aware that this is an incredibly demanding career path intellectually. I fully understand that I have no understanding. I am a blank slate. The only advantage I have for myself is that I've been playing with computers since I was a single-digit child. I have very little programming experience aside from HTML/CSS and a crappy language called Blitz+ that I used to make a b-tier Pong clone. I am fairly good at math because I don't just memorize formulas, I learn why they work, which helps me retain the ideas behind what different types of data reflect. I know that this line of work is something I am capable of doing, and feel I may enjoy.

When I was in my early twenties, I had no idea what I was doing, and so I let my life stagnate. The last 10 years has been a blur, but something has stirred in me and I can't stop it. I don't have any interest in stopping it, either. I have never been this motivated nor this scared before. It is like something awoke in me. Maybe it is because I went on a diet and got healthy this year, or because I had an idea and some took me seriously. Whatever it is, I have no interest in walking away, so if you can support me in my struggle to be more than I am today, share with me what you can.

  
I will be forever grateful, more than you may realize.



Thank you,

Hi everyone! This post is for you to share what you love and what you don’t about working in cybersecurity. I’ll start by giving you my perspective from the world of software development.

I’ve been working as a software developer for 3 years now, and after going through a tough consultancy job, I’m now at a good company where the work is pretty chill, and the salaries are decent. However, despite these advantages, I’m starting to feel increasingly bored. What frustrates me the most is the feeling that projects never end. No matter what I accomplish in a day, there’s always something left to do, and the next day, I have to pick up right where I left off. This creates a sense of “dread” because I know I’ll be facing the same issue tomorrow, and when I solve it, the cycle repeats. There’s never a day where I feel mentally clear and satisfied because everything’s wrapped up. That lack of closure makes the days feel endless.

On the flip side, there are good things too. The satisfaction of completing a project when everything goes well is an emotional high. But over time, even that doesn’t seem like enough for me anymore.

Evening all, 

Currently working for a good company in financial services.

Got offered a role today by a bigger company, pay is slightly less but I am negotiating to get at least the same; clear challenges with less areas to focus on so I'm hoping that equates to less stress and context switching, although slightly more travel.

I have been feeling burnt out for a while now. Was really hoping that the feelings would go away over the holiday break, but they haven't fully.

I should be more grateful to have the role that I do. The people are nice, they let me work hybrid (mostly from home, few days in office here and there), and I feel more or less appreciated for the things I do.

On the other hand, it's hard to think of the last time I had a low-key day where I wasn't working on an active project and could catch up on learning. I guess there were one or two days here and there over the past 2-3 months. As I finish my ongoing project, I can see the next one(s) coming in the pipeline, and I feel dread.

I am fairly certain that other people are not working on anything, or at least are getting much more downtime, and this makes me feel bitter. Some projects are vastly different than others and require learning so many new things in short periods of time that I feel like I am lost and drowning. Some projects have many stalls caused by client issues, then they flip out and try to rush us through the actual work.

I can't easily leave because postings for similar roles ask for several years experience and certifications that I don't have. I don't even confident in my abilities anymore to actually apply and interview elsewhere.

Hey r/Cybersecurity! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I wanted to share my experience and some advice for those embarking on the journey of self-studying cybersecurity.

## The Challenge

Let's be real: starting your cybersecurity journey can feel like trying to drink from a firehose. The field is vast, constantly evolving, and can be overwhelming at first. You might find yourself lost in a sea of acronyms, struggling to understand complex concepts, or feeling like you're always three steps behind.

But here's the thing: **every single professional in this field started exactly where you are now.**

## The Mindset

1. **Embrace the struggle**: Each challenge you face is an opportunity to learn and grow. The frustration you feel when tackling a difficult concept? That's your brain expanding.

2. **Consistency over intensity**: It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than to burn out with 8-hour cram sessions.

3. **Build a foundation**: Start with the basics. Networking, operating systems, and programming fundamentals are your building blocks.

## The Path

1. **Start with the CompTIA trifecta**: A+, Network+, and Security+. These certs will give you a solid foundation.

2. **Hands-on practice**: Set up a home lab. Break things. Fix them. Repeat.

3. **Dive into resources**: 
   - Platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox
   - Books: ""The Web Application Hacker's Handbook"" and ""The Hacker Playbook"" series
   - YouTube channels: NetworkChuck, John Hammond, David Bombal

4. **Join the community**: Engage in forums like this one, join Discord servers, attend local meetups or virtual conferences.

5. **Specialize**: Once you have a grasp of the basics, dive deeper into areas that interest you (e.g., network security, malware analysis, pen testing).

## The Reality Check

You will feel lost. You will question if you're cut out for this. You will have moments where nothing seems to make sense.

But then, something magical happens. You'll solve a CTF challenge that seemed impossible a month ago. You'll explain a complex concept to someone else and realize how far you've come. You'll look back and be amazed at your progress.

Remember: **Every lesson learned is knowledge gained**. Your journey might be rough, but it's also incredibly rewarding.

To those just starting: Welcome to one of the most exciting, challenging, and important fields out there. You've got this!

My view is that most of these articles and media stories are specifically about SOC analysts who run into the wall of alert fatigue, which is a very real issue.

For those of you that are still here (and have not completely abandoned the industry), I have 2 questions...

They complain they have no resources to work on projects we’ve highlighted as priorities but then they have plenty of time for pet projects or other security items they want to do.

They cut us out of every conversation, but I don’t understand what. We’re really collaborative, we never just say ‘no’..

Zero disrespect to anyone that has a different job, no offence meant. 

Iv been in cybersecurity 6.5 years now have had multiple roles and generally very very happy with the line of work. 

BUT I am starting to feel I would just want a job where I can go do what I need to do and go home. The nature of the field of work is very fast paced meaning the constant upkeep in news , threats , vulnerabilities and general information sometimes gets a bit much ! 

And the constant need to up skill is a killer sometimes when you just want to work away for a while if life is super busy outside work.

Last Friday, I passed the ISC2 CC exam, and while I'm pleased to have completed it, there was something that didn’t sit well with me. The challenging aspects of the exam seemed to be focused on testing a deep understanding of the material rather than just surface-level knowledge, which I can appreciate. However, some questions had intentionally tricky wording, which felt like it was more about tripping people up than genuinely testing their knowledge. Personally, I found this a bit frustrating.

I’m curious if it’s just me, or did anyone else feel like the wording was designed to be deliberately confusing?

For some context, I already hold the Security+ and Certified Ethical Hacker certifications, so I didn’t necessarily need the ISC2 CC for my career. Honestly, I took the exam mainly because I had some extra time on my hands and it was free. That said, I’m glad I did it, as it was a good way to reinforce my foundational knowledge.

Last year, after serving for 15 years, I left the military. Prior to leaving I’d decided to commit to a career in cybersecurity as I felt a real sense of excitement when envisioning myself in the industry, and I felt that my natural stengths, such as my analytical skills, would suit it well. After studying for a little while, I got jittery knees and changed my mind - instead opting for a career in exciting world of Health and Safety. I done this because I was on a short time line after getting medically discharged from the military after developing a viral brain infection, and I was also suffering with some cognitive impairment that made me question my suitability to move into an industry that required a great deal of cognitive function.

In short, I took the easy, risk-free option.

I’ve since recovered very well from the brain injury, and I’m currently in a health and safety management role on a salery of £50k. But it’s tedious and boring, and I feel a deep sense of not belonging here. I get very little enjoyment from my job. It feels very forced.

This, naturally, has made me begin to question my choice, and I’ve began looking at the possibility of jumping ship into the cybersecurity world again. But I have my doubts on how realistic this is for me.

The roadblocks now are mainly financial. I could take a pay cut down to ~£35k, but I’m a homeowner and married with 3 children, so i couldn’t realistically go lower than that. I also question employment opportunities that would be realistically available to me, and I’m almost 37, so I’m no spring chicken. 

If I were to commit to this, I’d look to use my experience with military intelligence to jump straight into a mid-level cyber intelligence role - which is something that I’ve been advised is attainable by a friend in the industry that is head of cybersecurity for a bank. 

Where do I sit with all of this? Are my aspirations unrealistic, and therefor I ought to just put up and continue in the H&S career that I’ve landed myself in, or is there a realistic opportunity for me to gain employment within the industry on that salary.

I've been working as a consultant in Incident Response for the last several years, so the work itself sounds very similar to what I do. I typically ignore the recruitment messages on LinkedIn, but for whatever reason, this one caught my eye. My primary question is:

1. Has anyone heard of this company before or had any experience working there? I could find almost nothing about it online, which seems like a red flag.

2. Ponderance is a 24/7 MDR response center. What's the typical work-life balance for something like this?

- Started as CTF player in 2016 
- Made into Bugbounties from 2017 
- Made enough money and quit bugbounty in 2021 to learn something new 
- In 2021, Joined a fintech company based in pune as a Senior Analyst and started managing bugbounty management.. Like onboarding applications, Budget allocation kind of program management role 
- Unfortunately it didn't last long... Due to family problem where I was in the situation I need to quit because I need to travel around 2,000 kms every week to take care of my parents as I was leaving away from them
- Immediately and blindly joined this SaaS company based in Chennai... Now part of AppSec team 


Problems that I'm facing 

- After joining the SaaS Company, again started in VAPT role... Nowadays I literally hate this alot especially doing the same stuff again and again...I really loved doing job in fintech Company because of new role and new responsibilities 
- After joining the SaaS Company, analysed their security posture gave them ideas on improving the security posture...Because the posture is really bad and Made a presentation... Discussed for 2 hrs and at the end of meeting... They told it won't work out and improvement idea which I made it was based on SaaS security posture
- So, eventually I left the idea and Made a decision that we have a bounty program... So left the pentest on web, APIs, Mobile behind and started focusing on new things which I didn't learn or experience in the past.. Chosen cloud native security part to start out with Kubernetes and Docker pentesting...Learned it and management told to focus on the VAPT... It really sucks

I posted this recently and got a lot of hate and brutal comments, so thought I'd make this more clear. My boss put me on this project to troubleshoot a bunch of machines. It's been ongoing but he sent me a new list for it 1-2 weeks ago. Some days, I was slow with it and some other days, I had other tasking so I'd focus on those first. I hadn't made a huge dent in the list but I made it through almost half in a week. When I say I was slow with it, I mean this is how I would do it: If a machine was giving me issues, I'd move on to the next, or I'd have to message somebody else about it. Sometimes, I'd be stupidly stuck on a machine and be like ""this isn't working"" and have my boss tell me much later that the OS version isn't compatible with an application I'd try to install on it. 

Anyways, on Thursday, he sent an email to me and a couple others saying that the progress seemed to be better and thanked us three and gave us a couple notes to keep in mind. Yesterday (Monday), he sends an updated list of machines. He sends me a message letting me know and he was like ""You are probably tired of chasing this squirrel"". I told him it's no worries. I was stressed out about a couple things yesterday and was in my head about them and I also had a couple meetings, so I was being really slow working on the updated list of machines. My boss started working on the list and was sending me updates as he was going down the list, so I tracked a couple of the other machines down and I was focusing on one difficult machine that was having trouble installing an application on. 

I left things up in the air when I left for the day, and figured I'd pick up where I left off when I came in today morning. I co go me in today morning, and I'm looking at emails and any chats I missed, and 30 minutes in, my boss tells me he's made more progress on the updated list he sent yesterday. He literally finished half of it at this point. I told him I'm currently looking at the few machines I took a look at yesterday (and specified the names of them), and he said he already finished those! He even finished the difficult one that was having trouble installing things and it's working fine now! I feel like I look incredibly incompetent. How can I make this up?",0.26471558213234,1

Hi All,

I’m in the opposite situation that I typically see on this reddit page and online. It is insanely slow at my job. I mean, very slow. On average we get about 2-3 security incidents a day that are known false positives. 

Theres 15 of us on my team. 11 people are policy makers, whereas 4 of us are technical/IR. I’m someone who likes to stay busy, and keep going, however theres not enough work to go around. What can I do all day? I always try to excel in my daily tasks and take on new projects wherever I can. I typically knock them out faster and more accurately than my coworkers.

My current tasks:
- security incidents
- EASM
- threat hunting

What I do daily/ try to in my (lots of) free time:
- study (THM/Youtube on John Hammond or others)
- news articles

I’m still quite new to the security scene, and the lack of work is not helping me learn really, at all. I always ask for tasks and things to do, however, the ‘policy makers’ don’t have the time to incorporate me. 

What are some things I can learn/work on?

Note: 
- I have 2 years IT, <1 security. 
- Company is ~20,000 people
- i’m comfortable with phishing
- I just built a SIFT vm to mess around with

Heya! I've been in a never ending battle to win back my machine. It has cost me around 5-7 windows machines. After combating them daily, and after discovering ways they got into my system using satellites, blue tooth, and even using the power cable, I decided to make the switch to Linux. Nitrux even.

  
Now all this is enough to make anyone paranoid, and being the skeptic I am, i had to run many tests to make sure I wasn't simply hacking myself. That was fun. The obvious appearance of some things such as another linux distribution, Ubuntu, as well as a whole bunch of new python scripts and libraries, along with a ""oh-my-zsh"" install, and a huge command list from Powerlevel 9k and I was pretty convinced that I was indeed, being targeted. 

The battle continues, I still manage to humbly get on here to make this post after doing more mods to thier system built on my system which was automatically reinstalling no matter what I deleted and I spent the day going through running every command available. (Aside from the ones like panic, and ""yes"")

I've discovered some more interesting things I thought you'd enjoy me sharing! 

#1. 2 million plus pages of RAM. around 1 million pages of ram running on thier remote machine. Wowza! Whats that smell like?

#2. They have stuff installed not only in my root, but right on top of the kernel. In the kernel.

#3. the internet is (was) looped and looped again. At this point I'm pretty sure even if you remoted in and looked, it would just look like me battling against myself. \*eyeroll\* 

#4. I think it was for intimidation purposes, but now residing in my root directory is a list of programs and stuff they are using. There is a start file, and an end file.  Having ruled out this being my own government, I think its probably safe to post said lists here for everyone to take a gander at. Just to give you an idea of what I'm dealing with, and well to let them know how sick and tired I am of playing host to thier stupid data collection that they've been running on my hardware for so many years.

I don't expect any help, at this point its like picking at a wart, but feel free to throw in your two cents and interpretations. Oh and of Note here is my entire list of applications that I currently have installed: Notepadqq (firejailed not working), Reaper 617 (firejailed not working), Musescore (havent opened yet), vlc media player (no media to play but it works!), Infectionmonkey(firejailed), Libreoffice (yay i can spreadsheet), Inskape, Blender, Krita, Upscayle, Firefox, station.

In my opinion our media (at least in Australia) has some responsibility in the lack of organizational cyber maturity through the shear amount of inaccurate reporting around breaches that occur, choosing sensationalism to sell advertisements and in turn causing senior execs to believe the crap that get published. 

Today one of our ""premier"" news outlets decided to interview a company Port Hedland Airport - middle of nowhere Australia as to how they survived the outage which caused so much trouble globally....

- Port Hedland Airport does not run the software in question

- The CEO doesn't know what they do run

- When looking out the window, there conveyor belts were still running so they were good

A bit of a background, I'm a Security Engineer working in the banking industry. Prior to this I came from a company that was pretty lax. Meaning, no red tape - things get done, fast, proficiently and effectively. 

If a project, such as a new security solution was approved and budgeted from the top down, all I needed to do was do my due diligence - questions, risk assessment, demos, POC, documentation, etc., and once I give my thumbs up, it was good to go. Things would get done in a matter of days if not week or two.

Now, in my new gig, it takes so much time, effort, and energy just to roll something out. For example, the project I am working on is board approved from the top down. All relevant stake holders were aware from day one. All were invited and only some joined some of the meetings. We've been having discussions/demos with multiple vendors for the past few months. We had a meeting to finally kick off the POC, but all of the folks on the IT side suddenly decided to have questions from out of left field, questions that needed to be asked to the vendors, which they had plenty of opportunities to. This put me in a bind. I didn't have the answers. It was so frustrating. I wasn't unprepared. I was prepared to talk about the solution. What it is. What it can do to help the bank succeed. Relevant stakeholders roles and responsibilities as it pertains to integrations. How it fills a gap. How it meets an audit/compliance check box, etc...this whole process started back in Q4 2023 for perspective.

I don't like to throw folks under the bus, but it needed to be done today. A C level and IT Manager were asking questions, which should have been asked to the vendor during one of the many calls we've had. We even had a scoping call to flesh out any questions or concerns that IT may have had. They were part of this call, and yet, the questions wasn't asked! I called them out on this.

Tribal knowledge, kinda elitism where if you dont know their interpretation of basic knowledge in developing then they cannot be bothered to guide you. Management is not making any changes cause why endanger delicate working vehicle. Rather in the end of listening to such just cover the problem with joke and problem stays the same.

1fyvk0a,"What is my real issue with Cyber?
I've been in the Cyber space for 4-5 years now and I've worked at two branches within the same company that whole time. When I was in school for Cyber Security, I thought I was really going to enjoy the work. I'm the guy that my in-law's reach out to with tech problems or asking if an email is legit or not, I'm the one who advises my family about staying safe online, etc. This has spawned from my role as the Information Security Awareness, Training, and Phishing manager at my company - I love the role, mostly. I use to like it more. 

I have worked for this company for going on 5 years now in the same position, more or less, and at two different branches in the company which were in two different countries. I've moved my family across the world for this company. A large reason for the move was to get away from a toxic CISO at my old branch. Now that I've moved to this other branch, my new CISO has begun to show their true colors and is arguably worse than my former CISO. 

Both CISO's have \*said\* that they care about the employee - ""Burnout is real"", ""Take breaks"", ""Take Vacation"". But they proceed to get mad at their employees for the dumbest crap (had a coworker get berated in front of guests at a presentation where he couldn't remember the acronym he was using and our CISO proceeded to chew him out in front of everyone). I once ran a phishing simulation which had some false positives. It was later found out that this was caused due to bad data from HR which included employees that had been terminated for years (some of them were even passed away) when the previous month's lists were fine, meaning a backend change happened at some point and changed my reports without me being told. My CISO proceeded to announce how I was making them look bad, along with the team. By ""look bad"", I mean that the CISO said I was making us look like ""Shit"" - this was in an email with me to our COO. 

That was all just my old CISO. My new CISO yells at me for things like using the moving service that my company paid for to assist me with moving to Germany. Evidently I'm only supposed to use them for urgent things - but getting my new born son registered with the German government isn't urgent? Or cost too much for a multi-billion dollar company? Most recently, I was yelled at because I informed my CISO during a one-on-one that my son might be a bit loud in the background since my wife was putting our daughter to sleep, meaning my son wasn't being attended to. My CISO understood this to mean that I was busy watching my son. She told me how I need to prioritize work and blah blah blah. I ended up becoming so frustrated with my CISO that I was basically yelling at them explaining why what they said was so offensive and wrong. My CISO also would treat a former colleague as if they were the dumbest person my CISO had ever met, even though the colleague has worked in Cyber / Technology since the late 90's. Basically forced the colleague to quit - which they did after handing in a doctor's note saying they needed a week off because of mental stress from our CISO. 

So, I guess my question is: Is the Cyber industry just toxic or am I just unlucky? What are some good, non-technology fields to pivot to? Will the military take a 32 year old veteran still? Cause I'd honestly rather deal with the military again than deal with another CISO.",,1
1fcb095,"Modern Red Teaming Roadmap
Hello all, I commented on a post a few months ago about a a modern red teaming roadmap. A number of people have messaged me about sharing this information and I cant respond to you all alas I will post it here for anyone interested. 

  
**Disclaimer:** I don't have all the answers and in the grand scheme of things i'm not really that good. What is contained below is my opinion which has been formed from red teaming over the last decade or so and having been lucky enough to see a number of top teams conduct some big tests and how things have changed over time.

  
**A couple of important principles:**

1) Evasion is a lot harder, defences are layered and in many cases defences / detections are not immediately visible. Act accordingly. You will need to write your own tooling. Get competent at native programming / reverse engineering and research the internals of your target operating systems.

2) The detection perimeter now extends to all of your internet infrastructure. You **MUST** have covert attack infrastructure which is resilient to analysis by those with access to core internet backbone net flow data. I won't name the company here but this is a commercially available service and will get you caught.

3) As a team / member of a team you will need to invest much more heavily in research and development of your tooling. In the last 3 years I have not witnessed a successful engagement that used cobalt strike including heavily customised versions of it. it will get you caught.

4) The threat intel is often very poor. Commercial entities are incentivised to attribute detected attacks to <insert authoritarian state here> because it makes them seem a lot more competent than they actually are. Take it with a pinch of salt. Even better learn about conducting your own operations to gather the relevant intelligence you need for you organisation. If you're interested I can cover some of this stuff in another post.

5) Aspire to be a threat actor first then a red teamer second. A real APT has operational goals, has an economic cost to conducting operations and cant ask to be legged up when they do something stupid. You're not in a race to get to the operational goal. Take your time, take acceptable risks. Understand the impact you are having on the target. Think sniper in a ghille suit stalking your target.

6) Stop trying to emulate threat actors. It's a load of rubbish , invented by someone trying to sell gullible people something they don't need. If anyone presents themselves as an authority on <insert nation state group / apt group here> ask them their background. If 1) it doesn't include a significant proportion of time in their countries bonne fide intelligence service 2) They have worked directly with that group, ignore everything they have to say. The operational cyber world is very clandestine and APT groups are probably actually lots of different entities that have been misattributed. People come and go, have different ways of doing things, leadership changes. just because fire eye says something is apt29 and that's how they work does not mean 1) It is actually them 2) They will ever operate like that again. We are selling ourselves short if we think the adversaries we are up against are that naive. They aren't. These places are organised to ensure the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. Someone next door doesn't know what's happening one room over. Someone at fire eye probably doesn't know either. Remember that and read the threat intel see things you think are interesting but take with a pinch of salt.

7) Get your head into the research and keep your finger on the pulse. Actors will weaponised high quality public research and use in their operations. You should too.

8) Embrace automation. Do you need 2 weeks standing up your attack infrastructure for every job? How many times do you do it a year? How long would it take to automate?

9) Work as a team. No one is infallible. We all make mistakes. Embrace a learning mentality individually and as a team. Do after action reviews. What could you have done better. Leave your egos at the door.

10) If you are on an internal red team then as a team you need to streamline your ability to test. The game we play is a matter of small details. Military operations are about having the right people in the right place at the right time with the right equipment to exploit a vulnerability in the disposition of an enemy force. Cyber isn't much different. Trust me a competent attacker that has your organisation in their crosshairs is probably doing continuous reconnaissance on your internet facing presence and likely has alerting configured should something relevant be discovered. If it takes you 6 months to get permission to test the smallest thing then that's probably too late. Continuous RT or GTFO. 

  
**Building a Strong Foundation of Relevant Skills**

I will break these down into Operator Skills and Capability Development skills. Capdev is the intersectionality between pure reverse engineering / research and software engineering. Examples include categorising an EDR software to understand how it works and then building a capability to defeat that technology.

  
**Operator Skills:**

1) Manual testing skills ( I really like OSCE3 for this ) yes it's not bleeding edge but it forms a good foundation to build on.

2) Active Directory - You are probably going to find yourself in Active Directory environments. Learn about how they work. How to attack and defend them; CRTO, CRTO2, CRT(P,E,M).

3) Cloud Hybrid Environments: A lot of places are using hybrid on premises and cloud based architectures. Learn about how you can abuse the access from one to the other and visa versa. CARTP, CARTE are good. Cyberwarfare labs has some courses as does S2 security (Ultraviolet Cyber ). There's probably more.

More specialist Red Team Operator Courses:

1) Heard good things about Rogue Labs.

2) SpectreOps course is good. Highly recommend.

3) BlackHills etc etc.

4) In the future I might have a course you can attend.

  
**Research Skills:**

1) You probably need to learn about how EDRs work. Matt Hand has a great book. James Foreshaw has just released a book about Windows Security internals. Ask Santa nicely for both.

2) Learn some reverse engineering. By first learning how to forward engineering in assembly. I cannot begin to describe how often I'm looking at assembly code. I know it sounds obvious but sometimes you just gotta look. And if you can look at how it's actually implemented vs how they think it's implemented well you might get lucky.

3) Learn some modern exploit development. If you find a binary exploit like in OSCP / OSCE in a modern environment it's probably a honey pot or you are in the wrong target. People who can afford red teaming tend to have good enough security that they don't leave free float ftp server on the perimeter. Modern exploit development is quite different from the good ol days. [pwn.college](http://pwn.college), opensecuritytraining, ret2systems, offensive con etc are good. Try and replicate and analyse previous interesting modern vulns.

**The E shaped and T shapes of Offensive Security Specialisation**

You will probably need to decide at some point if you want to be a T shaped offensive security engineer or an E shaped one. 

  
T shapes have a strong foundation of broad relevant skills and a deep expertise in a single area. Maybe you're an AD wizard, you're great at windows exploit dev, you can find and weaponise deserialisation bugs in your sleep, etc etc. Don't feel the need to be absolutely amazing at it all because you cant. just concentrate on what you want to get good at and add value to your team as a team member. 

  
E shapes have the same broad fundamental base of knowledge but have expertise in 3 or so areas. This expertise is still deep but it's not as deep as an T shaped. Im probably an E shaped engineer. Pretty good at EDR Evasion and Capdev, AD, and attack inf. But I'm not finding sexy web bugs and I'm ok with that.

A red team should really be made up of a couple of E's with different skills and supported by some Ts. High performing teams tend to adopt this structure almost evolutionarily.

**Specialist Training**  
Once you get to a certain level of maturity you're going to want to seek out very specialist training. My teams have sent people to OffensiveCon pretty much every year. There are others but I cant list them all here.

  
**Finding you own answers to your own questions**

A lot of the time you will probably have to just work shit out for yourself. Build a lab that is representative   , poke, prod, play, see how things respond. Did they align with your original hypothesis? Rinse and Repeat.

Hope you found it interesting and feel free to like, share, comment etc below. :-). This obviously doesn't cover the physical side which is quite a big topic in itself. 

Any questions I will try my best to either answer myself / find someone in my network whose opinion I trust on the matter.

Need honest opinion and guidance please.

I started as the ONLY security person for my organization and since day one I was handed a CPU, couple monitors, mouse and keyboard. I was just thrown in the mix of 5-30year organizational knowledge experienced people. No one seems to know what needs to happen, all the network team everyone gets direction from one person their manager and he has a very big influence across the department.

I am lost!!!! What do I need to do? Everyone is in their own “business” come in the morning and run into their cubicles or offices. I have no clue or guidance not even a tiny bit.

When a detection is triggered or a new CVE is announced I go through it; and I vet the threat intel we get every week. Support for end users, phishing attacks. Threat hunting.

I simply don’t get time to do anything else.

The organization has no security policy and procedures, no playbooks. Nothing in place and more so no one is willing to talk and collaborate, it’s like walking into a zombie house and everyone is beating their head at the desk. Some even watch videos or fall asleep at their desk.

I need help! What would’ve you done if you were instead of me? How would you go about it? I need to implement a security program and all the good stuff within it.

Looking forward to your feedback. Thanks",,1

**Intro:**

10 years.

This month marks a decade since I've been in IT. I thought I'd share my experience between starting out as a student employee for my K-12 school to a cloud security architect for a global consulting and service provider.

I'd also like to share my personal background and hobbies to keep it more casual and real than too formal (and how some of it comes full circle later on if you're interested enough to read). If you want to jump straight into the career part, skip to the header titled, **Help Desk (Age 18/19, No pay)**.

**TLDR:** I wrote this post to elaborate on my own personal and professional experience and self-discovery; my decade-long and counting journey in IT / Security, what drew me into infosec, lessons learned, and how I'm bettering myself as a person and professional within the community.

&#x200B;

**Bio / What Got Me Into InfoSec:**

'90s kid, born and raised by divorced parents in Middle America surrounded by farmland and ditches that stretch for 50 miles in every direction until the nearest city / town. When I was a kid, my passion was video games and music, more specifically, metal. Both of these were my escape from the angry, frustrating childhood I experienced rooted from my parents' divorce. They still are my passions, but as a kid, I lived, breathed, and bled video games.

In my youth, it was Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Tekken, Resident Evil, and Metal Gear Solid on the PS1, and Commandos on the PC. Youth to teenager, it was Max Payne, Hitman, Splinter Cell, Grand Theft Auto, Manhunt, The Warriors, Call of Duty, professional wrestling games, the list goes on, on the PS2.

I was very indecisive on what I wanted to do when I grew up. In middle school, I thought survival teacher. In junior high, I thought American military history teacher. In high school, I thought psychology. In college, I thought military. During the first 1.5 years in college, I changed my major probably 5 times on paper and 8 times in my head.

Over the years, I've learned two things:

1.) Call me crazy, but I believe I enjoyed these video games because there are many *threat modeling* aspects to them all, especially on the offensive side like Hitman, Splinter Cell, and Metal Gear Solid. You have objectives, you assess the situation you're given, and you have to figure out how to bypass / eliminate these threats in your way.

2.) Many, many, many people in infosec come from all backgrounds. Business, law, medicine, literature, music, zoology, etc. Just because a person didn't get a degree in business / tech / cyber doesn't mean they don't know anything about IT / cyber. Experience is what matters, and everyone needs to start somewhere. After all, the education system is broken and doesn't prep anyone for the real world.

\--------------------------------------------

**10-Year Career Path:**

&#x200B;

**Help Desk @ K-12 School (Age 18-19, No pay):**

I was 18-19 when I started out in help desk. It was an elective in high school that was practically a study hall. Myself and another kid were in the Director of Technology's office. We would help him if he needed a hand with something or answer the phone, troubleshoot, etc. for staff when he was away, which was often. He did everything from helping Betty plug her VGA cable into her monitor so her ""computer was no longer black"" anymore to the entire IT budget for the K-12 school system. It was mainly assisting with answering the phone, troubleshooting a smart board, set up MacBooks and iPad racks for the elementary and middle school, and run wire for surveillance cameras.

**Lessons Learned:**

None. I was too stupid at this age. All I cared about in my late teenage years were girls, my car, and my drum set. I had an '88 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. <puts sunglasses on>

&#x200B;

**Asset Protection @ Grocery Store (Age 20, $11/hr):**

My primary job during my high school and early college days was working at a grocery store. My grocery store was looking for an asset protection / loss prevention associate. Semi-jokingly, I applied, got 2 interviews, and was accepted. I say ""semi-jokingly"" because I truly never understood what that job was. All I knew was I got to walk around dressed normally without having a supervisor on my ass, or so it seemed. I was 20 and way too stupid to realize what I was diving into.

Asset protection / loss prevention is essentially physical security; monitor, detect, and prevent financial loss via fraud and theft from both employees (internal) and customers (external). For this role, there were mandatory classes that were held for a week or two about laws, store policies, self-defense, etc.; essentially a watered down criminal justice course.

There was so much thrown at me within the 6 months I had that role. I experienced coworkers bend the rules and attempt to apprehend thieves aggressively, chasing them in the parking lot, ripping their handbag off their shoulders with stolen merchandise in it, calling 911 multiple times a day to report theft, burning CDs with surveillance footage for local police and evidence for ongoing investigations, getting yelled at by meth head customers, investigating an incident on Thanksgiving Night where a traveling construction contractor lost his wallet at the store's gas station, which ended up being stolen by one of the employees who later quit, accidentally setting the fire alarm in the store off, quickly running to a fire in the deli department (different day) ensuring everyone was safe (they were), etc.

In my small, farm town, I caught one person - an old lady stealing cat food and other misc. items off the shelf who was caught doing it elsewhere in the region in the past. It was \~ $40 worth of items, and apparently enough for the cop that I called to arrest her right then and there in the security office, and I had to escort the cop with her in cuffs out to his patrol car.

It was a role I never anticipated being in, especially at an age where I couldn't even legally drink alcohol yet, but I learned a lot from it. Part of me was proud that I caught my first and only person because the on-the-job (OTJ) training quota was apprehending like 10 people within the first 6 months, which is what ultimately led to me switching departments versus just being released. But in hindsight, I really felt bad for the lady. No one knows what her life circumstances were, what issues she was battling, etc. But it was my job. Due to my ""poor results"" per the OJT quota, I switched departments before applying and getting accepted for a student employee position in the IT department at the college I was attending. My friend was already an employee there, and he helped me with the employment opportunity.

**Lessons Learned:**

*Adaptation*. Mentally, this job was a learning curve and noticeable pivot for me in my work ethic, attitude, hunger for knowledge, general curiosity, and tenacity. There was so much thrown at me, my brain couldn't wrap around all of it. It was a mental shift where I gained fuel for tenacity and adapted to the mentality, '*I don't care what I have to do to get the job done, so long as I know what I'm doing*'. I'm glad I experienced it, but don't miss it whatsoever. I liked the idea of potentially having a career in safety, so much so that I ended up having a phone interview with a safety manager who worked at the state level just asking about his career, why he likes it, what his path was, etc. But for this role? $11/hr wasn't enough for me to potentially get my ass beat or shot by an unhinged person on a random Tuesday.

&#x200B;

**Help Desk / Desktop Support @ College / University: (Age 20-22, Min. wage):**

Despite moving to another help desk role, I still didn't know what career I wanted. This was one of the best jobs I've ever had. I was part of a fantastic small team of network / sysadmins who really threw us into the frying pan with hands-on experience, which will always be the best way to learn. It builds self-discovery and soft skills.

I didn't know what a T-568B or what an RJ-45 plug was. I patched my first cable, redid the entire cable management and desktop / workstation setups in classrooms and conference rooms, ran wire through the ceilings, set up IP cameras, troubleshot with users via controlling their screen through System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), now known as Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, printers, degaussing hard drives, physically destroying them, re-imaged devices, etc.

When I got my Associate's, I transferred to a university to pursue for my bachelor's. But before I transferred, I learned that the college's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) was an information security guru. Didn't know anything about information security, but the terminology fascinated me.

*Access control, risk management, firewall, vulnerability management, etc.*

For some reason, I thought Security was all coding. I was absolutely 100% clueless, and was evidently unaware I had already done Security (the asset protection role).

Before I continued my post-secondary journey at the university, I found the Desktop Support Manager of the university's email, sent him an email directly with my résumé, and asked if he offered / needed student employees to help. He replied a week or so later asking for an interview, which I got and was accepted immediately, essentially doing the same thing but on a much larger scale. Instead of 5 IT people, there were around 200, all scattered within different departments, i.e. Helpdesk, Desktop Support, Security, Enterprise Applications, Database, college / building support, etc.

Told my new manager about my interest in Security, in which he put word out for me to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of the university for a potential internship opportunity. I had an interview with him a few weeks later on Friday, October 21st, 2016 at 10am in his office. He was happy to move me into Security starting Monday.

Right place, right time.

**Lessons Learned:**

*Google.* Oh my God, people, GOOGLE IT. This is one of, if not, THEE most universal example everyone should understand. One of the questions the director and sysadmins asked me in my job interview was, ""What do you do when you don't know the answer to something?"" My response was, ""Ask someone else."" ""What if no one else is available?"" ""...Google?"" ""Yep. Correct."" Even if someone was nearby and you knew they have the answer, still attempt to find out yourself. Resist relying on others. Obviously not all the time since it's not *always* possible, but prohibit yourself from always having someone fetch information for you when you can simply Google the answer or try accessing what you have access to, to find what you're looking for first **before** relying on others.

*Under promise, over deliver*. Tell a customer you can fix their issue in 5 days and it takes you 5 hours, you're a hero. Tell a customer you can fix their issue in 5 hours and it takes you 5 days, you provided a bad service, even if the end result was exactly what they wanted. Bottom line is you promised 5 hours, and it took you 5 days. Word on bad experiences aka reputation gets around quicker than good experiences. Think before you say. Soft skill 101.

*Orange-white, orange, green-white, blue, blue-white, green, brown-white, brown*. Networking 101.

I truly believe if you want to work in IT, whether it's Security or not, Helpdesk is the absolute most best place to start. You learn the basics, you learn the people skills and soft skills, which can take your career to an incredible distance.

&#x200B;

**Security Intern @ University (Age 22-24, Min. wage):**

During the interview with the CISO, he asked me what made me interested in security. I responded exactly what I said above. ""Honestly, I don't know anything about it, but the terminology fascinates me."" He took that as a positive in that I was simply *curious*.

The CISO was also a lawyer, which was another shift in my curiosity. It made me wonder, ""Why is a lawyer working in cybersecurity? I thought you went to law school to work at a law firm or self-practice."" I thought it was a stupid question, so I kept it to myself, but answered it on my own the next \~ 2-3 months of being there - HIPAA, SOX, GDPR, etc. Where, how, and why the law intertwines with technology alone was / is still super fascinating enough for me to say, ""This is definitely what I want my career to be.""

Helpdesk / Desktop Support and Security are apples and oranges in terms of permissions and rights. As a result, I didn't have anything to do at least 80% of the time I was employed there, but did the grunt work, i.e. Excel, setting up devices in the ""lab"", deploying hardware to a separate campus, etc. The crew was awesome in that they were no nonsense, sarcastic people, annoyed with end users, and were passionate about what they did. I fit right in with these guys.

I would do a couple tasks and be done for the day unless they needed me to do some grunt work in Excel. Those tasks were to enter tickets for what we called the ""Top 10"". The Top 10 were the top ten devices that had the highest risk score passed a certain threshold that day. I would enter a ticket to order the asset owner(s) to remediate the vulnerabilities on the device.

I would also handle copyright infringement. We would get an email from a production studio company like Paramount Pictures, telling us someone on our network with X IP address on Y date / time was illegally downloading / streaming content they didn't pay for. Via Splunk queries, I was able to map the identity of the details of that user given in the email, document what they watched, when they watched it, on what device they watched it on, etc., and submit the form to the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards (OSC&CS). Essentially, it was a slap on the wrist to them more than anything, but damn, did that power feel good for Lil 22 year-old me.

Through my colleagues outside of work and school, I was starting to attend the following local security conferences - Information Systems Security Association (ISSA), Information Systems & Audit Control Association (ISACA), and InfraGard. ISSA is generally everything security. ISACA is mainly geared towards auditing and security. InfraGard is an organization partnered with the FBI mainly focused on U.S. critical infrastructure.

Then came 2017; one of the worst documented years in cyber history, mainly due to WannaCry. Quantitatively speaking, we didn't get hit hard. Qualitatively, we got hit so hard, it was only worse than the Equifax breach because human safety was at risk. All because of a ransomware attack. Luckily no one actually died, but holy shit, what madness this field can be. That was my one and only shit-hit-the-fan moment in this field where it was a true positive, and luckily I was only an intern, so I didn't have any accountability / stress of rem, but I got a taste of the real cyber world with the best seats in the house; front-row, center.

One of the architects retired from the university to go work elsewhere as an analyst. That company was offering an IT internship. Through his word and my application, I got an interview and was accepted.

**Lessons Learned:**

*Networking.* If your colleagues have positive things to say about a specific person whether it's work ethic, great character, both, etc., get to know them. You could not only learn from them, but chatting with them can build yourself a connection.

*This business changes every 2 minutes.* It really is cyber police. Most of the time, the work can be boring until the short-lived adrenaline rush from a potential incident kicks in. Even now, every week I see a company that was hacked or a global tech giant that was fined for violating laws.

*Cover Your Ass (CYA).* Document. Everything. Seriously.

*For the love of God, don't use Windows XP devices for crucial operations, i.e. providing gas to hospital patients who literally rely on those to live.*

&#x200B;

**IT Internship @ Agriculture Company (Age 24, $18/hr):**

I had two roles with this job. I was originally put in with project management to handle metrics and status updates on SAP tickets and defects. This was the worst role I ever had. Not only did the 50, 60-year old PM want me understand her god awful paralysis-by-analysis Excel spreadsheet, but I never understood nor learned a thing, and she wanted me to contact everyone physically (not via Skype chat) who needed to provide updates so she can update her slide deck.

I was already a disgruntled dude who doesn't want to be bothered and who knows what it's like when a random stranger, especially an intern, approaches you with a clipboard, nagging at you for input. She wanted me to do this every Monday, and I ignored the physical approach. I would message them on Skype, so I'm not bothering them and that they don't feel micromanaged. Plus, I didn't want to be known as ""that guy"".

She disagreed with me and was upset that I didn't physically approach with them, and the task eventually was handled by the other intern who was hired; who, by the way, kept talking about how he missed his ex-girlfriend so much and that he wanted to show up at her house with roses wearing a tuxedo begging for her back. I'm sitting there in there in my head like, ""Dude. I have to test the configuration and utilization of this software. Can I go back to testing while listening to the OST of Hitman: Contracts?""

So I asked for other work around the office and ended up assisting with the identity & access management (IAM) and governance, risk, & compliance (GRC) teams. It was a little bit of Security and a little bit of internal audit. They were in the midst of migrating to ServiceNow, to which I was selected to perform some security and software assessment and testing on. That was okay, but it definitely beat being the lame PM henchman.

I was finishing the last course for my Bachelor's that season and was hunting for my first full-time job. I was accepted for a position as a Support Specialist at a small bank in my hometown, which so happened to be the first IT role in that town for probably several years.

**Lessons Learned:**

*More networking*. This was only a summer internship, so I wasn't here long. But in my short time of being here, I met A LOT of people; most of which I met just by scheduling 1:1 meetings with to learn about their background and how they got to where they were. That's a potential hack for interns: If you want to network, but just don't know where to start, try scheduling 1-on-1 meetings with individuals you're interested in learning about. You learn a lot about their personal and professional background, depending how open you are. It builds connections, potential friendships, and overall networking. Someday, that person you met through a simple 1:1 meeting could get you in at another job.

&#x200B;

**IT Support @ Small Bank (Age 24, $41k/yr):**

Part of me wants to backtrack and say **this** was the worst job I had, but I actually learned from this job. Mainly what *not* to do. I was provided the opposite of my lessons learned from the help desk days. I was over-promised and under-delivered and unappreciated. I was promised free training during the interview, but it was never brought up again after that day. I was promised to learn more networking / communication aspects, but was never offered a task. I sat there for 2 months doing nothing.

Everyone who worked there was nice personally, but their work ethic sucked. One guy had been there since the late 70s and was disgruntled and tired, and said, ""I hate this place"" every day. And he was my favorite of the bunch. The late 50s / early 60-year old I shared an office with kept falling asleep on the job and was on his phone constantly. This guy was also the father of my high school prom date (lol). The one and only helpdesk admin would walk to work from his house and immediately FaceTime with his wife and kids when he sat in his cubicle behind me. My direct supervisor lived an hour away and wouldn't come in until 10-10:30, be on the phone all day bullshitting with people (rarely anything work related) and would be on the toilet somewhere between 3:30 and 4, and be there past 5. This was also the guy who had hired me, promised me training, and didn't teach me anything because he wanted to be the ""hero"" to come in and save the day and not pass any knowledge to me. Without a shadow of a doubt, the worst boss I ever had.

I did get permission from him to start building and developing security policies, guidelines, standards, baselines, etc. That was fun, but it was all for nothing when I found out that none of them were even reviewed and completely fell off the radar. I think he just had me literally do something to make myself seem useful. Yet, I'm his employee, so I should be his shadow, but guess not.

I also provided new Dell workstations to users and developed an entire re-imaging / validation process from acquiring the old device and providing them with the new. I came in at 5am during the week for a couple weeks and sometimes on Sunday mornings to catch up where I left off. It was a big ask, and I wanted to prove myself. My direct supervisor didn't care at all, and all the Chief Information Officer (CIO) said was, ""Good"" and walked away. It was right there that I knew I was worth way more than this.

The CIO, who was also the Chief Operations Officer (COO), once engaged me and said their helpdesk admin cannot be trusted. The CIO and helpdesk administrator have nearly come fisticuffs and on more than just one occasion during the 6 months I was there. And that wasn't even the worst part about this role.

Christmas Eve was my very last day. My supervisor asked if I stay at the office until he was there. He didn't get there until 2-3pm. He cornered me and asked me for my password. He claimed that he needed my credentials so that he can use my account to have full control on other users' access from when I went about creating images for people's devices. I wasn't entirely understanding how that was possible and given that it was my last day, I caved in pretty easily and wrote it down for him.

Immediately, hindsight kicked in, and I was pretty pissed at myself. To this day, I still look back on that and wonder why the hell I didn't bother laughing at his face and ignored him. But I had nothing against the people there personally, I just knew I'd never go back there even if they offered me $250k/yr.

The last thing I did was deploy more Dell devices by driving a van full of equipment 2.5 hours away to their mortgage / loan branch and set up workstations there, which was a multi-day process. It was nice to stay at a random hotel and get out of that hellhole for a short period of time.

I knew a guy who I used to work with who had an executive role for a business services company. He had passed my résumé onto HR, and I eventually was reached out to, got an interview, and accepted for a consulting role in Security.

Funny enough, when I told the bank's CIO I was quitting to go work for a consulting company elsewhere that's paying me $17k more for work I actually want to do, he was unsupportive of my decision and said, ""It will chew me up and spit me out"" and that he could've ""easily"" seen me being the CISO of that bank.

So *consulting* will chew me up and spit me out, yet I can *easily* be envisioned as a *CISO*. As someone who hadn't been a consultant yet nor a CISO, I was baffled by this statement, but essentially said it's my own decision, and I'll take my chances.

**Lessons Learned:**

What *not* to do. There was the bad, and there was the ugly. Notice I didn't mention good because, well...there wasn't any.

**Security Analyst to Cloud Security Architect @ Global Consulting & Service Provider (Age 24 - Present; $58k/yr - $118k/yr 4.5 years later):**

I wouldn't say this was a new life chapter, but a new whole book. This was the real deal. A full-time role in a city, 2+ hours away from home, finally living on my own for the first time in my life. These were the bachelor years. I feel I owed the guy who put word in for me for this new role and growth opportunity. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have this. I got a mediocre apartment in a central spot located within city limits, with everything from the home office, to groceries, to downtown, to the airport, all within 20 minutes or less from me.

Every new hire for this company is essentially trained from the get-go to be a consultant, despite that not being everyone's role. It was standard protocol. There were about 20 new hires with me. During onboarding, we took a consulting course that really challenged me as it wasn't anything I experienced before. Every time someone said, ""scope"", I would just think of a Leupold rifle scope.

After onboarding, there was the 2-week mandatory training, which was essentially more consulting-oriented classes. This took place in a major city along the west coast where we were there for 2 weeks practically for free. Just the idea of being over 2,500 miles away from home was one of the biggest breaths of fresh air I've ever experienced. We took classes for 8 hours, we explored the city on the weekends, and even hiked up a mountain as a group activity.

That mountain hike was actually an interesting demonstration of team work. Our team lead purposely put this together, so that he could also visually point at who was marching ahead, who stayed back to help others, who was checking in, etc. There was no right or wrong, any expectation, it was nothing more or less than an observation to him, and to ourselves.

Training and fun is over, now we get into the heart of it. I'm immediately put on a project within my new home city with a bank. Then a manufacturing company. Then a hospital. All of these were short-term engagements where we were selling them Microsoft solutions. This was Intune and Defender - back when it was known as Advanced Threat Protection (ATP).

I was then on the bench for about 4 months. ""The Bench"" is a consulting term, or so I think. I didn't know anything about being on the bench, what it meant, how it could impact me, etc. Being on the bench is generally not a good thing because it means you're not chargeable to another client aka you're not billing time towards a client. Being on the bench, at least to this company, means you're expected to keep applying to other roles so you can get staffed, but until then, take training and get a new certification every 2 weeks. As someone who is a terrible test taker, this made my heart sink. The training and certifications are free regardless of the outcome, but passing a whole new test every 2 weeks is insane. Luckily, I was able to get a fundamentals certification that I believe saved me from getting fired. In hindsight, it does make sense. Executives are going to eventually wonder why they're paying me $60k/yr if I haven't been staffed to a client.

During bench time, I was finally staffed to a Managed Security Services (MSS) team of about 12-13 people (now we're at 40+). We were a small group of shared resources where all of us were staffed to multiple clients simultaneously. So we had the same managers and resources on multiple projects. This was nice for two reasons.

1.) If you're staffed to 4 projects and released from 1, you're still staffed to 3, so you're not on the bench. In other words, you remain chargeable.

2.) More clients means more tools and technologies to learn and play with, which means more experience, which means growth.

In the last 5 years, I've worked with clients in aerospace & defense, government, banking, manufacturing, and medical industries. I've worked with cloud & infrastructure security, cyber defense, data protection, and elements within, i.e. security information & event management (SIEM), endpoint detection & response (EDR), data loss prevention (DLP), file integrity monitoring (FIM), threat & vulnerability management (TVM), identity & access management (IAM), and governance, risk, & compliance (GRC). On the business service side, I helped facilitate a 24x7 business model for our remote security operations center (SOC) team. I trained and still train analysts on all shifts with different tools for different clients helping them navigate and utilize specific tools and how to apply it to our incident response plan (IRP) for that client.

Between then and now, I was promoted 3 more times. What helped was me positioning myself to being the backup for every subject matter expert (SME) I worked with. I didn't know the tool as much as the SMEs did, but I did know enough to know what it does, its purpose, and the alerting (if any), monitoring, and reporting (if any) aspects of that tool. I would say this is a key point if you want to be an architect. You don't need to know everything at a granular level, but you do need to know the basics of the what, where, when, and how. What is setup, where is it located, when does it do its purposeful actions, and how.

This isn't something that can be learned in a short period of time. A lot of grunt work, a lot of tedious tasks, and a lot of red tape, especially when your clients are in the public sector. The worst thing I ever experienced in this role was working with another team for a government client that made me work on an Excel spreadsheet with 25-30 tabs, VLOOKUPs everywhere, 15-20 pivot tables, and the output of all this was their threat & vulnerability management (TVM) metrics. I wish I was exaggerating when I said this, but it took me from 6am - 10pm (16 hours, not a typo) to start and finish this sheet. 50% because it was confusing, 50% because my laptop couldn't handle the size of this file. Finally 10pm hits, only to be told the real thing was already submitted and that this was ""just a practice round"". Oh, and this was also during a July where my A/C wasn't working nor my apartment complex was taking an effort to fix.

That was one of many inconvenient work tasks I've had, and there are countless I've had in the last 5 years, but that was easily the worst by far. What kept me with this team was the support group that came with it. These guys are nice personally and some of their work ethic has a coasting feel to it because they've been doing this longer than me. However, a work / life balance is perfected with this team, and that is really what matters to me. Some clients can be hell, but that's what a supportive team is for. Some clients can be hell, but in the end, you're going to come out with something you didn't have before.

**Lessons Learned:**

*Identify, plan, execute, evaluate, adjust, and repeat.* When this process becomes second nature, any goal becomes achievable. It's funny how this job works. If you break down infosec concepts, they apply to life like math where you do it almost every day but don't realize it.

There's certainly way more, but I found the above lesson to be the most important truthfully.

\--------------------------------------------

**Present Day:**

On the professional side, my current role is a Technical & Compliance Lead for a client with an Azure GCC High environment. It's stressful, but being a jack-of-all-trades, I'm learning many valuable skills I can carry with me elsewhere. I'm also studying for the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).

On the personal side, I have a girlfriend, I'm almost 30, and have really counted my blessings in the last year or two. I'm incredibly fortunate and lucky to have had the experience I've had in this field and the people I have in my life to this day. What's changed between then and now is an increased chance of burnout.

Burnout is real as fuck. Mental health is enormous and why a work / life balance is crucial for me. I was burnt out for a while until I discovered a game called Deep Rock Galactic - easily one of the best co-op games I've ever experienced. It's enough for me to unplug and reset my mental capacity. And hey, there's threat modeling concepts within it. :) I'm also interested in audio and sound design. This is a hobby of mine that tremendously helps with burnout. Also, walking. Taking daily walks is one of my favorite activities because I get to go outside, stretch, get the body mechanics in motion, and just think clearly to myself. It's almost like my meditation.

In my early to mid 20s, I was all about the work because it was all I really had. I was on the grind with commuting to college, doing homework, and finding roles to gain experience. Now that my 20s are closing up shop, I'm focused on my life now and what life is going to be like 30 years from now.

*Who do I want in my life? Who do I want to exclude in my life? Where am I in life? Where do I want to end up in life? What life goals have I accomplished? What other life goals do I want to accomplish?*

These are questions I now ask myself every day that can apply to a lot of general life concepts. Ultimately, it all boils down to what you value.

**My Lessons to You:**

*Google. Take an initiative. CYA. Network. Get a hobby.*

Best of luck to up and comers, newbies, seniors, and veterans who reside in this field with me. Please feel free to ask any questions.

Enjoy your Wednesday!",,1
194p7ss,"Another “Is cybersecurity Bootcamps worth it” post
Edit 3: This post has gotten close to 50% upvote rate, bunch of shares and a good number of views. Maybe something that might give another person some help. I'm going to give a quick summary here so others looking up the same thing might get some insight, as well for my own reference. Thanks again for all the comments, suggestions, and help!

**Generalization of the outlook I got about bootcamps.**

* ""Save your money"", ""It's not worth the money.""
* There are free resources that provide the same amount of content and might be more up to date than what you would find in a bootcamp 
* Difficult industry to break into and a very saturated field 
* Cybersecurity is ""several rungs up the IT ladder"", not really an entry level thing in most cases. Lots of knowledge is needed in the IT field as a whole. 
* Programming bootcamp per say, is more directed to a specific skill, as ""cyber security"" is a vast array of accumulated knowledge 
* Most people who have taken a bootcamp say it's not worth it 
* Some who've taken a bootcamp say it worked, but I noticed this was a number of years ago 
* Some good boot camps but a lot are subpar or even scammy 
* Make sure if you do a bootcamp, do one that offers assistance getting a job 
* A degree will give you more knowledge and more options as a whole 
* Use transferrable skills as a direction so as to not have a fully cold start when in the interview process 
* Networking and connections are super important

&#x200B;

**Comment that I found kind of wrapped up the general consensus.**

* u/jc16180 ""Any guided training that provides structure will always be helpful. But for the amount of money they charge? No.""

&#x200B;

**Hypothetical pipeline. Some people say it takes years, others got lucky.** 

* Experience, work in IT field while getting certs 
* Security+ knowledge , Google cert (gives a discount to the security+), IMB or equivalent 
* Analyst/secops 
* Work into engineering

&#x200B;

**Resources** 

* Hackthebox.com and tryhackme.com have courses, are up to date, and are interactive 
* WGU.com offers online degrees 
* John Strands pay what you can antisyphontraining.com/pay-what-you-can/ 
* NGOs that may help

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Thanks to everyone that took their time and commented! I really do appreciate all the info and didn’t expect to get so much! Thanks again!

I need a job that can be done remote and provide flexible hours all the while to pay enough for medical bills and rent in/move out of California. Unfortunately this kind of a job everyone wants as it would be nice, but its something I need due to my limitations. The allure of promised work with my resume collecting dust is some good bait for these boot camps hahaha. Basically it sounds like I need to be looking at actual entry level jobs instead of the false “entry level” cybersecurity job. I’ll see what I can do getting a help desk IT job and get experience/certs at the same time. Sounds like if I go the degree route though I’ll definitely need a bachelors to be able to compete. Honestly I dont think I have it in me and I dont think I can afford the time. Think my real option is to wait for the DOR to get back to me or if there is some other assistance for the disabled. Hopefully there’s another route I have missed.

Once again thanks for all the comments and a good dose of reality from people who have actually done these boot camps and who work in the industry.

Edit: wow this got approved in my sleep hahaha. Thanks for all the replies, I’m just starting to go through them

Hey!

I apologize for redundancy but wanted to ask the same question but with some personal context.

I recently became disabled and after some years I’m getting back on my feet. The repercussions of my disease though is my current profession and a lot of other career fields are not an option. After a lot of deliberation, considering my age, a career in something more digital seems like the best option. On the waiting list to talk to the department of rehabilitation.

I’m not looking to make serious bank or anything but just get a job really haha. There’s a lot of positive reviews about boot camps but many posts and videos about how they aren’t worth it. I’m not a Luddite but I definitely need to learn the basics.

In a case like I’m in, would a bootcamp be a more worth while endeavor? Spending 2+ years for an associates or bachelor would be tough in my position due to time, but if it’s drastically more worth while then I’ll have to consider it.

Would love to know if anyone has some sage advice or suggestions. Thanks!",,1
1aso6ah,"Passed the CCSP
Took the exam today -> Passed it!

150 questions. It was difficult but I didn't take the full 4 hours. I finished in about 2.5 hours.

I struggled with the legal portion of the exam - never my strong suite, but the data protection, infrastructure security, and cloud concepts were easier. 

If I had to offer a piece of advice:

Read the entire question and all the answers at least 2 times -- read every word! I had some questions where I would think that the answer was A, but I re-read the question and saw one word that I didn't notice before and I changed my answer to B. Every word matters! The questions are purposely written to make you think it through - it's not as easy as question -> answer. There are multiple right answers, and you have to find the best one.

My studying XP might be different than yours - I got the book/test bundle and read through the CSA guide. Some might need more, some might need less - but I recommend the official Sybex book bundle -- well written and it goes over most of the topics on the exam.  Took me about a month to finish it and understand the concepts.

I'm not a video learner - I need to read, so I didn't do any video based courses.

Oh, and remember to get a good night sleep before -- underrated IMO.

Good luck!",,1

Hi Cybersecurity members!

Just want to venting out, im working on cybersecurity area just because this is what i took when i was on university..

and it was an 8 years ago.. 

Currently im feel tired of this area, almost every single day i need to catch up with the current cybersecurity news. As security consultant, i need to working together with customer.
And if there are some issue and related to the security solution that i design or suggest to them, i feel guilty and impact to the my personal daily life. i always overthinking about that situation and thinking im not good enough for them.

especially if there is pressure from customers, I will keep thinking about it until I can't sleep.

I have sometimes thought about stopping working in this area, but I need money hahaha ​​if I move to another area this is all I can do....


Wishing to you guys, what happens in your work dont make it to impact your personal life or your mental. :)

Happy Monday!",,1
1astbwt,"Is it a fairy tale to want to get into Tech, but also have a good work life balance?

Don't read this as not being passionate about this area-one just gets a sense of a lot of extreme hustle culture at the expense of time with friends/family/good sleep/other hobbies.

1gjxxlv,"Googles AI Breakthrough in Cybersecurity serves as a warning
Google has unveiled a world-first innovation: AI discovering a zero-day vulnerability in widely-used software. Through a collaboration between Google’s Project Zero and DeepMind, the ""Big Sleep"" AI agent identified a memory safety flaw in SQLite, a popular database engine. This achievement is a milestone in cybersecurity, leveraging artificial intelligence for enhanced protection.

The groundbreaking find underscores the power of AI when combined with skilled ethical hackers. Google’s Project Zero, known for hunting down critical vulnerabilities, and DeepMind's AI expertise are setting new standards with this large language model-driven agent. Big Sleep is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in preemptive security measures.

Traditionally, fuzzing (injecting random data to uncover bugs) has been a key tool, but it has limitations. Big Sleep aims to overcome these by detecting complex vulnerabilities before software even reaches users. This could pave the way for AI to become an integral part of software testing, catching issues traditional methods miss.

Although still experimental, Google’s Big Sleep points to a promising future. As AI tools evolve, they could streamline vulnerability management, making it faster and more cost-effective. With innovations like these, defenders may finally stay one step ahead in the cybersecurity race.

I've kept saying this is going to happen and now Google has actually done it, programmed Al to discover zero-day vulnerabilities. This should be a warning becaus malicious security hackers will be looking for 0-day vulnerabilities this way as well and a celebration because Al will help in finding those vulnerabilities.
